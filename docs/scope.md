# Scope: LLM Arena

Send one prompt, watch up to three AI models answer it at the same time, and vote for the best one. Over time those votes and the real per-call numbers, speed, tokens, cost, build an honest leaderboard of which model is actually worth using.

Build it in a thin, working slice first, one prompt actually reaching a model and coming back, before making any single part of it fuller. Then thicken it piece by piece. Before building anything, decide what you're doing and why in a few plain sentences, then build it, and if the plan turns out wrong once it's actually built, say so and fix the plan too, not just the code.

Whenever a "build it" style step actually gets underway, break it into its own short list of what's genuinely being done, and check each part off as it's finished, right in this file. That way this file can be opened fresh, in a brand new conversation, and it's obvious what's already done and what's still left, without anyone re-explaining the feature from scratch.

## Stack

Already decided, nothing open here: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn for components (card, button, popover, loading skeleton, and whatever else the UI actually needs as it gets built), Prisma with Postgres, Clerk for auth, Arcjet in front of the endpoint, PostHog for analytics and observability.

## Sketches

There are rough hand-drawn sketches for the arena screen, the leaderboard, and the models page. Treat them as structure only, where things sit, what exists on the page, not as the final design or the actual colors, all of that is already decided elsewhere in this file. If something in a sketch genuinely contradicts what's written here, stop and ask which one actually wins rather than guessing.

## Foundation

### 1. How the app actually connects to a model

The Next.js project itself gets created manually first, `create-next-app`, fast and simple, no reason to spend agent time or tokens on something that easy.

Two real decisions still open once that exists: how the app calls OpenRouter to get a model's answer, and how streaming three models back to the browser at once should actually work. This one's worth real thought: routing all three through one shared connection looks simpler, but if that one connection drops, all three answers die together, which breaks the whole point of one model failing never affecting the others. Decide both properly, then wire them, along with Prisma, Clerk, and Arcjet, into the project that already exists.

PostHog should be wired in from the start too, session replay and heatmaps turned on, and tied to the signed-in user once Clerk resolves, so events are attached to a real person, not left anonymous.

#### Decided

**The Next.js project already exists.** `create-next-app` was run before any of this started, Next 16 App Router, React 19, Tailwind 4, TypeScript strict. That part of this feature was already satisfied on arrival.

**Calling OpenRouter: Vercel AI SDK v7 with `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider` v3.** Server-side `streamText` per model. Raw `fetch` with hand-parsed SSE was the real alternative and it would have worked, but feature 6 requires PostHog's own per-call LLM analytics, and `@posthog/ai` wraps AI SDK providers directly. Choosing raw fetch here means hand-rolling that tracing later, plus cancellation and usage parsing, to save two dependencies. Not worth it.

**Streaming to the browser: one HTTP request per model, never one shared connection.** Three independent `POST /api/chat` calls, each naming a single model, each returning its own stream. This is the decision the feature description flagged as worth real thought, and it resolves clearly:

- Independent failure is the entire premise of the product. A multiplexed stream means one dropped connection kills all three answers together, and one server handler that must never throw for any model.
- Independent retry falls out for free. A failed model retries on its own while the other two keep streaming, untouched.
- Per-model time-to-first-token and tokens per second get measured on that model's own request, honestly, instead of being inferred from interleaved frames inside a shared envelope.
- Three concurrent requests sits well under the browser's per-origin connection cap, so the simplicity argument for multiplexing buys nothing real.

Timing and token counts travel in the stream itself, so the number on the response card and the number written to the database are the same measured value, not two independent estimates that can drift.

**Environment variables fail fast in `instrumentation.ts`.** A single zod-parsed env module, called at server startup, so a missing key is a loud crash on boot with the variable named, not a confusing runtime error on the first prompt.

_Corrected once built._ The original plan said putting the import inside `register()` would be enough to keep `next build` from needing production secrets. It isn't. `next build` evaluates route modules to collect page data, and `/api/chat` imports the OpenRouter provider, which imports env, so the build demanded real keys and failed. The fix: env is exposed as `serverEnv()`, a memoised function rather than a module-level constant, and the OpenRouter provider and Prisma client are both built lazily on first use. Startup validation still happens, `instrumentation.ts` just calls `serverEnv()` explicitly. Anything added later that reads env or opens a connection at import time will reintroduce this, so keep it lazy.

**Scope correction, agreed before building.** This feature originally read as wiring Prisma, Clerk, Arcjet and PostHog completely. That would quietly make feature 1 the entire foundation. Instead feature 1 _boots_ all four, env validation, Clerk middleware and provider, a Prisma client singleton, PostHog with session replay and Clerk identity, and leaves the parts that genuinely belong to other features where they belong: Arcjet's actual rules ship with the endpoint in feature 6, and the real tables ship with feature 3.

#### What got built

- `infrastructure/env.ts`, zod-parsed server env behind `serverEnv()`, forced at boot by `instrumentation.ts`.
- `infrastructure/database.ts`, lazy Prisma 7 client over the `@prisma/adapter-pg` driver adapter, cached on `globalThis` in development so hot reload doesn't exhaust the connection pool.
- `prisma/schema.prisma`, generator plus one `User` model keyed to `clerkId`. Feature 3 extends this file.
- `proxy.ts`, `clerkMiddleware()`. Next 16 renamed the middleware entry point from `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts`. It protects nothing yet on purpose, route gating is feature 8's call. _Partly superseded:_ `POST /api/chat` requires sign-in as of feature 6's Arcjet layer, because the rate limit needs a real user to key on. Feature 8 still owns page visibility and sharing.
- `features/analytics/posthog-provider.tsx`, PostHog with session replay and heatmaps on, identifying from Clerk and resetting on sign-out.
- `features/chat/*`, the zod request schema, the OpenRouter provider, the metrics stopwatch, and `streamModelResponse`.
- `app/api/chat/route.ts`, one model per request.

Timings ride back as AI SDK message metadata on the finish chunk: time-to-first-token is stamped at the first `text-delta` via `onChunk`. Cost is a literal `0`, which is the honest measured number here, not a placeholder.

**Tokens per second is wall clock, request to finish, and that is a correction made after measuring.** The original plan measured it over the generating window only, first token to finish, reasoning that a slow model shouldn't be penalised twice for a wait it already reported as TTFT. Measuring three real models proved that wrong. Some providers stream token by token and others buffer the whole answer and flush it at once; against a buffered response the generating window collapses to milliseconds. One real measurement read **23,550 tok/s** for 397 tokens, next to 2.35 tok/s from a model that genuinely streamed. Those two numbers are not the same measurement and cannot share a leaderboard column. Wall clock is the only figure that stays honest across both providers and can never go absurd. It does include the initial wait, which is acceptable because TTFT is displayed separately right beside it. Re-measured after the change: 18.71 and 23.1 tok/s for the same two models, comparable and plausible.

A stray `lib/prisma.ts` was also removed. It was a second Prisma client pointing at the old generator output path, so it broke the typecheck, and it bypassed the env fail-fast with `process.env.DATABASE_URL!`. `infrastructure/database.ts` is the only client.

- [x] Decide the approach
- [x] Install and configure the dependencies
- [x] Env module with fail-fast validation at startup
- [x] Prisma client singleton and a schema that migrates
- [x] Clerk middleware and provider
- [x] PostHog wired, session replay on, identified from Clerk
- [x] `POST /api/chat` streaming one model through the AI SDK
- [x] Typecheck, lint and production build all pass, with no secrets present
- [x] Verified: a malformed body returns a plain sentence and a 400
- [x] Verified: a rejected model call streams a human sentence to the client while the real provider error goes to the server log
- [x] Verified: a missing variable crashes startup and names the variable

#### Verified against real credentials

Confirmed on 2 August 2026, with real keys in `.env.local`, a running dev server, and `curl`.

- Server boots clean with every variable present, loading `.env.local` only.
- Database is real Prisma Postgres at `pooled.db.prisma.io`. Migration `20260802103016_init` is applied and the `users` table exists with the expected four columns.
- OpenRouter key is live. The catalog returns 337 models, 14 of them free tier, which is what feature 5's picker will read.
- **A real prompt reached a real model and streamed back** with true measured metrics: TTFT 982 ms, 21 input / 8 output / 29 total tokens, cost `0`.
- **Independent failure is proven, not assumed.** Three models were called concurrently, two real and one invalid id. Both real models streamed to completion with their own separate metrics while the invalid one failed on its own connection, returning a plain sentence to the client and the real `AI_APICallError` to the server log. Neither survivor was affected.
- Clerk gates the endpoint: an unauthenticated `POST /api/chat` returns 401 and a plain sentence. Clerk and PostHog both load client-side on the rendered page.
- Arcjet reaches genuine decisions with the real key, confirmed as `errored: false, denied: true, reason: ArcjetBotReason`. Bot detection denies non-browser clients outright, which is why `curl` cannot reach the rate limiter at all.

#### Still unverified, and why

- **The token bucket's rate-limit branch never fires for `curl`,** because bot detection denies first. It needs a real browser session, so it gets confirmed when feature 6 puts a UI in front of this endpoint.
- **PostHog events landing in the project.** The script loads and initialises client-side, but nothing has confirmed an event arriving in the dashboard, since that needs a real browser and a signed-in user. Check it when feature 6 ships the first real prompt flow.

### 2. Coding standards & tooling

Write down the real conventions for this project once it actually exists, then install linting, formatting, and a pre-commit hook that actually enforces them.

#### Decided

**The conventions live in `docs/coding-standards.md`, split into what a machine enforces and what a person enforces.** That split is the whole point. Every rule listed as enforced has a config line behind it and was probed to confirm it actually fires; every rule that cannot be honestly linted is written down as a review rule instead of being approximated by a rule that would produce false confidence. "If the same Tailwind classes appear in three places that's a component" and "never show a raw provider error" are both real rules with no honest lint rule behind them, so neither got a fake one.

**Prettier owns formatting, ESLint owns correctness, and they never overlap.** No `eslint-plugin-prettier`, so lint output stays entirely about things that are actually wrong rather than about spacing. `printWidth: 90` was chosen to match the code feature 1 already wrote, so adopting Prettier was a near-no-op diff instead of a repo-wide rewrap. `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` sorts class lists into one canonical order, which stops class churn from showing up in diffs.

**The pre-commit hook is fast on purpose: `husky` runs `lint-staged` over staged files only.** `eslint --fix --max-warnings=0`, then Prettier. Typecheck and build are deliberately _not_ in the hook. A full `tsc` on every commit grows with the codebase and becomes the thing people skip with `--no-verify`, and a bypassed hook enforces nothing. `CLAUDE.md` already requires typecheck, lint and a real build after every change, which is the right place for them: once, when the change is finished.

**Lint warnings fail.** `pnpm lint` runs with `--max-warnings=0` and so does the hook. A warning nobody has to fix is a rule that does not exist.

**The rules that mechanise this project's actual law**, beyond the defaults:

- `no-explicit-any` raised from warning to error.
- `prefer-const`, `no-var`, `no-param-reassign` with props, for the immutable-data rule.
- **`process.env` banned everywhere except `infrastructure/env.ts` and `infrastructure/public-env.ts`**, with `NODE_ENV` and `NEXT_RUNTIME` exempt because they describe the runtime rather than configure the app. This is the rule that earns its keep: feature 1 records a stray Prisma client that bypassed the fail-fast env validation with `process.env.DATABASE_URL!`, and this makes that a lint error rather than something caught by luck. Config files that run outside Next are exempt, since they cannot import a `server-only` module.
- **Feature boundaries via `no-restricted-imports`:** a feature imports its own files relatively and may not reach into another feature by alias or by climbing out with `../`; `infrastructure/` imports no feature and no route; nothing outside `app/` imports from `app/`. This matches the import style feature 1 already settled into, so it enforces the existing convention rather than imposing a new one.
- The `jsx-a11y` rules worth having as errors, as a floor under the accessibility baseline.
- `no-console` allowing `error` and `warn`, because that is exactly how a real provider error survives server-side while the user sees a plain sentence.

_Correction, found by building it._ The `process.env` ban had one genuine conflict: `features/analytics/posthog-provider.tsx` is a client component and cannot import the `server-only` env module, but Next only inlines browser variables when it sees a literal `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_X` access. Rather than granting the feature file an exemption, the read moved to **`infrastructure/public-env.ts`**, the one module that owns browser-visible config. Confirmed after the change that the value is still inlined into the client chunk and no un-inlined `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG` reference survives the build, so this is a refactor with no behaviour change. Anything added later that needs a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` value adds it there.

Prettier also reformatted the vendored skill docs under `.agents/` on the first run. Reverted, and `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `generated/` and the lockfile are now ignored. Not ours to reformat.

- [x] Decide the approach
- [x] Prettier, `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`, husky and lint-staged installed and configured
- [x] ESLint extended with the strict, env, boundary and a11y rules
- [x] `format` / `format:check` scripts, `lint` raised to `--max-warnings=0`
- [x] `docs/coding-standards.md` written, linked from `CLAUDE.md`
- [x] Repo formatted, existing code adjusted to satisfy the new rules
- [x] Verified: a probe file with `any`, `var`, a banned `process.env` read, a cross-feature import and a click handler with no keyboard handler trips every rule, while `process.env.NODE_ENV` stays allowed
- [x] Verified: the hook actually blocks. A staged file with `any` fails the commit; a merely misformatted one is fixed and re-staged automatically
- [x] Typecheck, lint, `format:check` and a real production build all pass

### 3. Data model

The core things every feature depends on: users tied to Clerk, threads, each model's own messages inside a thread, and votes. A vote should only ever be possible on a turn where two or more models actually answered.

#### Decided

**The unit is a _turn_, not a flat list of messages.** `User → Thread → Turn → ModelResponse`, with `Vote` hanging off the turn. One turn holds the user's prompt once and fans out to one `ModelResponse` per model. This is what makes "a vote only exists once two or more models answered" expressible at all: a vote attaches to the thing being compared, which is a turn, not to any individual message. A follow-up is simply the next turn, and one model's own separate conversation, which feature 6 requires, is the thread's turns with that model's response taken from each. The alternative, a flat message table with a role column, would store the same prompt three times and give a vote nothing coherent to point at.

**A failed model call is a real row, not an absent one.** `ModelResponse.status` is `STREAMING`, `COMPLETE` or `FAILED`. Dropping failures would quietly let a model that dies often outrank one that answers slowly but always finishes, which is the opposite of the honest leaderboard this product exists to produce.

**The metric columns mirror `ModelResponseMetrics` exactly, nullable in the same places.** Same field names, same nullability, so the number rendered on a response card and the number stored are the same measured value rather than two estimates that drift. `costUsd` is `Decimal(10,6)` and `tokensPerSecond` is `Decimal(10,2)`, not floats, because one is money and the other is a comparison key on the leaderboard.

**No `Model` table.** `modelId` is a string column and the leaderboard groups by it. The catalog is OpenRouter's live free-tier list, which feature 5 reads directly; mirroring 14 rows into Postgres buys a sync problem and nothing else. A `modelName` snapshot rides on each response so an old thread still renders after a model leaves the catalog.

**One vote per turn, owner only, enforced by a plain unique on `turnId`.** Feature 8 says a public viewer sees everything but only the real owner actually uses the thread, so there is no per-user vote on someone else's turn to leave room for.

**The "two or more answers" rule is enforced in application code, inside a transaction, not by the database.** This was the one genuine fork and it was asked rather than assumed. A database-level guarantee would need a denormalized `answeredCount` on the turn, maintained on every response finish, plus hand-written SQL in the migration that the schema file cannot see. That trades a counter which can drift for a guarantee that a single write path already gives. So `features/voting/cast-vote.ts` is that write path and nothing else may insert into `votes`, which is now also written down in `docs/coding-standards.md` as a review rule. The count and the insert share one transaction so two simultaneous clicks cannot both read "two answers", and the unique index on `turnId` is the backstop underneath that.

**Ordering is by `createdAt`, with no position column.** Turns are appended one at a time by a single owner. There is no reordering and no concurrent insert for a position column to protect against.

**No `visibility` column yet.** Public sharing is feature 8's decision; adding a column now would bake in a rule nobody has made.

_Scope correction, agreed before building._ Feature 3 was planned as schema and migration only, with each feature writing its own queries against `@/infrastructure/database`, so nothing gets written on speculation about shapes feature 6 does not have yet. That still holds, with one exception found by building it: choosing application-level enforcement for the vote rule left that rule living nowhere but a comment. `castVote` therefore ships here, because it _is_ the constraint, not a query written ahead of its caller.

#### What got built

- `prisma/schema.prisma`, extended with `Thread`, `Turn`, `ModelResponse`, `Vote` and the `ModelResponseStatus` enum, all `@@map`ped to snake_case tables. `User` gains `threads` and `votes`.
- Migration `20260802112549_arena_data_model`, applied to the real Prisma Postgres.
- `features/voting/cast-vote.ts`, the single transactional write path for a vote, returning a typed refusal (`turn-not-found`, `not-your-thread`, `not-enough-answers`, `already-voted`, `response-not-a-candidate`) rather than throwing, so feature 6 turns each one into a plain sentence.
- Cascades down the whole chain: deleting a user removes their threads, turns, responses and votes.

#### Verified against the real database

A throwaway user was driven through the real shapes features 6 and 9 will use, every constraint was checked by trying to break it, and the whole tree was then cascaded away. Confirmed on 2 August 2026.

- All five tables and the status enum exist; `costUsd` is `numeric(10,6)` and `tokensPerSecond` is `numeric(10,2)`.
- One turn wrote three responses, two complete and one failed. Cost defaulted to a real `0.000000` and speed kept its precision at `18.71`.
- The same model answering the same turn twice is rejected by `model_responses_turnId_modelId_key`.
- A second vote on the same turn is rejected by `votes_turnId_key`, and a vote pointing at a turn that does not exist is rejected by the foreign key.
- Feature 9's actual leaderboard query, grouping by `modelId` with wins joined from votes and average speed over completed answers only, returns the expected `1/1 @ 18.71 tok/s` shape.
- Deleting the user left zero threads, turns, responses and votes.

`castVote` itself was then driven through a temporary route on a running dev server, since this project has no test runner by decision, and the route was deleted afterwards. All six paths behaved: one complete answer plus one failure refuses with `not-enough-answers`; voting for a model that failed refuses with `response-not-a-candidate`; a different user refuses with `not-your-thread`; a made-up turn refuses with `turn-not-found`; the owner with two real answers succeeds and writes exactly one row; voting again refuses with `already-voted`.

- [x] Decide the approach
- [x] Schema extended with threads, turns, per-model responses and votes
- [x] Migration created and applied to the real database
- [x] The vote guard shipped as the single transactional write path
- [x] Verified: every unique, foreign key and cascade holds, checked by trying to break each one
- [x] Verified: the vote guard refuses below two answers, refuses a non-owner, refuses a failed model, and allows exactly one vote
- [x] Typecheck, lint, `format:check` and a real production build all pass

### 4. Design & look

A coffee or dark brown background, warm, not neutral gray or true black. One accent color, rust, used only for things you interact with, buttons, links, focus states, the win-rate bar, never as decoration. Because the background and the accent are both warm tones from the same family, the accent has to stay clearly brighter and more saturated than the background, enough that a button never blends into the page behind it, that's a real risk with two warm colors this close and worth checking by eye, not just by the numbers. Blue, indigo, and purple are never the accent, under any circumstance. Green is reserved only for marking a winner, red only for errors, never reused for anything else. Contrast should genuinely hold up in both light and dark mode, not just look fine at a glance.

#### Decided

**The palette is expressed in OKLCH, and the "accent never blends into the background" rule becomes a number instead of a hope.** Every surface in this app is the same warm hue family, roughly 50–75° hue angle, carrying almost no chroma: the browns sit around `0.014` chroma and only lightness separates them. Rust carries roughly `0.16`. So the accent is never less than **ten times more saturated than any surface it sits on, and at least 0.40 lighter than the page** in dark mode. That gap is the guarantee. It is checked by eye too, on a real screen, because that is what the scope asked for, but it is not left to eye alone.

The dark ladder, which is the design's home: page `oklch(0.19 0.014 55)`, card `oklch(0.23 0.016 55)`, popover `oklch(0.26 0.017 55)`, border `oklch(0.32 0.018 55)`, text `oklch(0.94 0.008 70)`, quiet text `oklch(0.72 0.012 65)`, rust `oklch(0.64 0.16 42)`. Light mode is warm paper, not white: page `oklch(0.97 0.008 75)`, card `oklch(0.99 0.005 80)`, border `oklch(0.88 0.012 70)`, text `oklch(0.22 0.015 50)`, quiet text `oklch(0.48 0.015 55)`, and rust drops to `oklch(0.52 0.17 40)` so it still clears 4.5:1 as link text on cream. **One rust hue, two lightnesses, one per mode.** Not two different accent colors wearing the same name.

**Rust and error red are neighbours on a warm wheel, and that is a real hazard this palette creates.** Rust sits at hue 42, error red at `oklch(0.60 0.20 22)`. Twenty degrees apart is enough to read as different when they are side by side and not always enough in isolation. So **error state is never signalled by color alone**, it always carries a word and an icon, which the "plain human sentence, always" rule already demanded anyway. Same for the winner green, `oklch(0.70 0.13 150)`: a winner is marked with a badge that says so, and the green is confirmation, not the message.

**The token layer adopts shadcn's CSS variable contract, repainted warm, rather than inventing its own names.** shadcn is already in the stack, and every component pulled in later reads `--background`, `--card`, `--border`, `--primary`, `--ring`, `--destructive`, `--muted-foreground`. Inventing a parallel vocabulary means every single component gets hand-patched forever. So those names are ours, they just hold coffee and rust. Three tokens shadcn has no name for get added: `--winner` for the green, `--display` for the serif, and the win-rate bar's track. All of it lives in `globals.css` behind Tailwind 4's `@theme`, which is exactly the "shared values live in `globals.css`" rule, mechanised.

**Typography: Newsreader for display, Geist Sans for everything else, Geist Mono for every measured number, at whatever size that number deserves.** The serif-versus-Geist fork was asked rather than assumed, and the answer was a serif pairing. Two things then changed once the `frontend-design` skill was actually read, and both are corrections worth recording rather than quiet edits:

- **Newsreader replaced Instrument Serif.** The skill names "a warm cream background with a high-contrast serif display and a terracotta accent" as one of exactly three looks AI design defaults to regardless of subject, and that is almost a description of this brief. The palette is not negotiable, it is written above and the skill is explicit that the brief's own words win. But the typeface was a free axis and Instrument Serif is the centre of that cluster. Newsreader is a variable face with an optical-size axis built for reading on screen, so it holds up at both 40px and 18px, and it is not the default answer.
- **The big numbers are mono, not serif, and that is the one deliberate risk in this design.** A product whose entire claim is _real measured numbers_ should let the data face be the display face. Prose is serif, measurement is mono: a win rate at display scale in tabular mono reads like an instrument, and the same figure in serif reads like a magazine pull-quote about a number somebody else measured. It is one token to reverse if it turns out wrong on a real screen.

**Mono means "this is a measured number", never decoration**, and every mono figure carries `tabular-nums` so metrics under a response card do not jitter sideways while tokens are still streaming into them. All three faces load through `next/font`, self-hosted, with fallback metrics, so there is no layout shift.

**The signature element is the instrument strip.** Under each answer, a mono row where TTFT lands first, then speed, tokens and cost settle in, each figure dim until it has genuinely been measured and then settling to full contrast over 150ms. That settle is the only animation in the app. It is where all the boldness gets spent, and it is the one moment this product has that a chat UI does not: you watch the measurement happen. `$0.0000` sits in that row without apology, because a measured zero is still a measured number.

**Theme is class-based via `next-themes`, defaulting to the system setting.** The sketch puts an explicit toggle in the sidebar footer, and a real toggle cannot be built on `prefers-color-scheme` alone, so the media-query block currently in `globals.css` gets replaced by a `.dark` class on `<html>`. Dark is where this design lives, but light is a first-class mode held to the identical contrast floor, not an afterthought that merely renders.

**Hairline borders do the separating, not shadows.** A drop shadow on a dark brown surface is invisible and still costs a paint. Surfaces are distinguished by one lightness step plus a 1px warm border. Radius is a small scale off a single `--radius` of 10px, cards 12px, pills full round, nothing sharper.

**Motion is close to nothing on purpose.** Streaming text just appears, with a caret, no shimmer chrome over the top of the actual product moment. Skeletons appear only where there is a genuine wait with a known shape, the leaderboard table on first load. Transitions cap at 150ms and `prefers-reduced-motion` removes them entirely.

_Amended during hardening, and recorded rather than quietly edited:_ "the instrument strip settle is the only animation in the app" now has exactly one exception, the skeleton breathe, and the "known shape" clause turned out to be the load-bearing half of this rule rather than the throwaway half. Both are argued in [the skeleton entry under Hardening](#loading-states-that-hold-the-screens-shape).

**The accessibility floor, which is a gate and not an aspiration:** body text at 4.5:1 and borders and large text at 3:1, in both modes; a 2px rust focus ring with a 2px offset visible on every interactive element in both modes, and `outline: none` never appears without a replacement ring in the same rule; full keyboard operation of the toggle, the picker, and the vote buttons; color never the sole carrier of meaning, per the rust-versus-red hazard above.

**What "build it" means here is the token layer plus one throwaway page that proves it.** No feature screens, those belong to features 5 through 9. The proof page replaces the `create-next-app` contents of `app/page.tsx` and shows, on one screen, the surface ladder, the type scale, buttons in every state including focus, a fake response card with mono metrics, a fake leaderboard row with the win-rate bar, a winner badge, and an error state, in both themes. It exists because "check by eye that a button never blends into the page" is not something reading CSS can answer. Feature 6 and 9 delete it when the real screens land.

**Not doing:** no per-model brand colors, the scope already parked that; no third theme; no CSS-in-JS; no shadcn components installed on speculation, each one arrives with the feature that needs it.

#### What got built

- `app/globals.css`, the whole token layer. Both modes, shadcn's variable contract repainted warm, the type roles, the focus ring, the `tabular-nums` rule, and the `prefers-reduced-motion` reset. Four component classes for patterns that would otherwise be copy-pasted Tailwind in three places: `.text-display`, `.text-eyebrow`, `.text-readout`, `.metric` and `.surface`.
- `app/layout.tsx`, Newsreader added beside Geist Sans and Geist Mono, `suppressHydrationWarning` for the theme class.
- `features/theme/`, the `next-themes` provider and the toggle.
- `infrastructure/ui.ts` with `cn`, and `components.json` pointing shadcn at these tokens, so `shadcn add` later generates against the real palette instead of running `init` and overwriting `globals.css`.
- `app/page.tsx` and `app/instrument-strip.tsx`, the temporary proof page.

#### Verified

**The palette was measured before a line of CSS was written, and measuring changed it twice.** A script converted every OKLCH value to sRGB and computed real WCAG ratios. Two failures, both fixed:

- The first error red, `oklch(0.6 0.19 22)`, read **3.88:1** on a card and failed the 4.5 floor. It is now `oklch(0.68 0.19 18)` at 5.37:1.
- The first light-mode rust, `oklch(0.52 0.17 40)`, was **outside the sRGB gamut** and would have been silently clipped to something other than the chosen colour. It is now `oklch(0.52 0.15 40)`, in gamut, 5.40:1 on paper.

The final run is 24 pairings, all pass: body text 15.5:1 dark and 15.9:1 light, quiet text 7.4:1 and 6.0:1, rust as link text 4.7:1 and 5.4:1, a label on a rust button 5.2:1 and 5.7:1, winner green 6.7:1 and 6.0:1, error red 5.4:1 and 6.5:1, and control edges 3.3:1 and 3.6:1 against the surfaces they sit on. The scope's own separation rule holds numerically: rust is 0.45 lighter than the page and carries 11× the chroma of any surface in dark, 19× in light.

**The rust-versus-red hazard is now a measured figure, not a worry.** They contrast **1.14:1** against each other in dark and 1.13:1 in light. That is near-identical luminance, so they are told apart by hue alone and are effectively the same colour to a red-orange deficiency. Hence the rule: colour is never the only signal, the error carries an icon and a sentence, and the winner carries the word.

**A real flaw found by inspecting the served CSS rather than by reading the source.** The focus ring was written as Tailwind's `ring-2`, which compiles to `box-shadow`, and a box-shadow ring is clipped by any `overflow-hidden` ancestor. Response cards and leaderboard rows are exactly that, so a focused control inside one would have lost its ring entirely. It is now a real `outline` with `outline-offset`, which nothing clips.

Also confirmed against a running dev server: the page returns 200 with zero errors in the log, all three font families ship with fallback metrics, `--font-display` resolves, `tabular-nums` is present, and Lightning CSS emits hex fallbacks alongside the OKLCH that match the measured swatches exactly, `#d96533` dark rust and `#ad4216` light.

- [x] Fonts wired in `layout.tsx`, `--font-display` added
- [x] `globals.css` rewritten as the token layer, both modes, shadcn contract

- [x] Verified: the focus ring survives an `overflow-hidden` card, after being rewritten because it did not
- [x] Typecheck, lint, `format:check` and a real production build all pass
- [ ] **Needs a person:** confirm by eye in a real browser that rust never sinks into the brown, in both themes, and tab the proof page to see the ring on every control

## Slice 1: Core arena loop

### 5. Model picker

An "Add model" popover pulling OpenRouter's live free-tier list, sorted by context window, capped at three models, defaulting to all three selected, with removable chips next to the prompt box. Also render that same catalog as a simple `/models` page, name, context window, and pricing for each one, so anyone can browse the full list without opening the picker.

#### Decided

**The catalog was measured before deciding anything, and it changed two of these calls.** `GET https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` on 2 August 2026 returns 337 models, 14 of them `:free`, exactly matching what feature 1 recorded. Sorted by context window the real top is Nemotron 3 Ultra at **1,000,000** tokens, then a run of five at 262,144, down to 128,000. Both `pricing.prompt` and `pricing.completion` are the string `"0"` for every free model, which is the honest zero this app already commits to showing. The placeholder catalog's model names are all invented and every one of them is wrong, so `features/models/placeholder-catalog.ts` is deleted rather than corrected.

**The catalog fetch lives in `infrastructure/model-catalog.ts`, not in a feature.** Two different features need it, the picker inside the arena's composer and the `/models` browse screen, and the layering rule says a shared thing goes to `infrastructure/` rather than one feature reaching into another. It also genuinely is what that folder holds: a client for an external service, alongside the database, Arcjet and OpenRouter clients. Built lazily like all of those, per the standing rule that `next build` must not demand a real key.

**The picker UI belongs to the arena, the browse page belongs to `features/models/`.** This is the honest split, not a workaround for the import rule. The popover is a composer control, it only makes sense sitting next to the prompt box and the send button, so it ships in `features/arena/`. The `/models` page is a screen for reading the list. They share data, not markup, and the data is in `infrastructure/`.

**The endpoint is public, so the fetch sends no key, and the response is zod-parsed per row.** Unknown fields are ignored and a malformed row is dropped rather than throwing away all fourteen, because OpenRouter adding a field or shipping one odd entry should never be able to empty the picker. Cached with Next's `revalidate` at one hour: this list changes on the order of weeks, and re-fetching per request would put a third-party round trip in front of every page render.

**The default trio is the highest-context model from each of three distinct providers.** Sort by context window descending, then walk the list taking a model only if its provider hasn't been taken yet, until three are held. Today that is Nemotron 3 Ultra (NVIDIA, 1M), Ling-3.0-flash (inclusionAI, 262K) and Poolside Laguna S 2.1 (262K). This was the one genuine fork and it was asked rather than assumed. Plain top-three-by-context is simpler and matches the sorted list the user is looking at, but the free tier is currently five NVIDIA models out of fourteen, so that rule can hand somebody three flavours of one vendor as their first ever comparison, which is the least informative arena this product can open with. A trio pinned by id in code would read better today and go stale silently as the free tier churns. The provider rule stays derived entirely from live data and still degrades sensibly: fewer than three providers just means it falls through to top-of-list.

**Nothing is filtered out of the list.** The fourteen include a content-safety classifier and several with image, audio or video input. Every one of them is a real free text-generating model this app can call, and quietly hiding some behind a name heuristic would be curation pretending to be a catalog. The default-trio rule is where taste gets applied; the list itself stays complete.

**Selection is client state in the arena, not persisted.** No localStorage, no URL param. Feature 6 stores the models with the thread when a prompt is actually sent, which is the durable record, and inventing a second one now would mean two sources of truth to reconcile the moment threads exist.

**One model minimum, three maximum, and the cap explains itself.** At three the "Add model" trigger is disabled with a plain sentence saying why rather than vanishing, and an already-selected model shows as selected in the popover instead of disappearing from it. The last chip cannot be removed, because a composer with nothing to send to is a dead end, not a state.

**Closing a real hole this feature makes closable: `/api/chat` will reject a model that is not on the free list.** Right now the route takes any `modelId` string, which means a signed-in user can name a paid model and spend real money against our key. The route cannot check that today because it has no catalog; once `infrastructure/model-catalog.ts` exists, it can, and it returns a plain sentence and a 400. Written down here rather than left to feature 6 because this feature is what makes it possible.

**shadcn's popover arrives here**, the first component pulled in, since feature 4 pointed `components.json` at the real tokens. No `command`/`cmdk` search: fourteen rows is a list you read, not one you search, and the dependency buys nothing.

**Context windows format decimally, `1M` and `262K`, not the placeholder's divide-by-1024**, which renders a one-million-token window as "977K". Kilo here means the round number a person holds in their head, not a binary kibi.

#### What got built

- `infrastructure/model-catalog.ts`, the **pure** half: the `CatalogModel` type, the cap and the floor, the zod row schema, the parse-and-sort, the default-trio rule and the context formatter. No I/O at all.
- `infrastructure/fetch-model-catalog.ts`, the **effectful** half, `server-only`: one cached call to OpenRouter, returning `null` rather than throwing.
- `infrastructure/ui-kit/popover.tsx`, the first shadcn component in the project.
- `features/arena/model-picker.tsx` and `features/arena/composer.tsx`, the picker and the selection state, lifted out of `arena-screen.tsx`.
- `features/models/models-screen.tsx`, rewritten as a live table. `placeholder-catalog.ts` deleted.
- `.measure-bar` in `globals.css`; the four pages that render a catalog now fetch it and pass it down.

**The split into a pure module and an effectful one was not the plan, and it is better than the plan.** The plan said one `infrastructure/model-catalog.ts`. Building it surfaced a real conflict: the module has to be `server-only` so no key or fetch strategy leaks browser-side, but the picker is a client component and needs the cap, the floor and the context formatter at runtime. Rather than exempting anything, the pure rules moved to a module with no I/O that either side can hold, and the network call sits alone in the module that imports it. That is the "side effects at the edges" rule arriving on its own.

**shadcn's `ui` alias moved from `@/features/ui` to `@/infrastructure/ui-kit`.** As generated, `components.json` would have put every primitive inside `features/`, where the boundary lint rule forbids one feature importing another's files, so the very first `shadcn add` would have produced a component nothing was allowed to import. A UI primitive owns no domain and is shared by everything, which is the definition of the bottom layer, so it belongs beside `infrastructure/ui.ts`. One line in `components.json`, and every later `shadcn add` lands in the right place.

Two edits to the generated popover, both recorded in the file: the `tw-animate-css` utilities were removed because this project does not install that package, so every one of them styled nothing, and the unused parts (`Anchor`, `Header`, `Title`, `Description`) were dropped rather than kept as dead exports.

_Correction, found by building it._ **The plan said the "Add model" trigger is disabled at three, and that is wrong.** Disabling it makes the only route into the list unavailable exactly when somebody wants to swap a model, so the only way to change your mind is to delete a chip first, blind, before seeing what you would replace it with. The trigger stays operable and changes verb to "Change models"; the refusal moved inside the panel, onto the individual rows, where it can be specific. Same shape at the floor: with one model selected, that row is the locked one and the footer says why.

_Correction, found by looking at the served HTML rather than the source._ A summary line read **"1Mwidest window"** in the browser while looking perfectly correct in the JSX. A JSX text node that wraps across lines has its line-leading whitespace stripped, so the space between an expression and the text after it disappeared when Prettier wrapped the line. It is now one template string, with a comment saying why, because this will happen again to the next person who wraps a line of interpolated prose.

#### Verified against the live catalog

Confirmed on 2 August 2026 against a running dev server and the real OpenRouter endpoint. `castVote`'s pattern was reused for the parts `curl` cannot reach: a throwaway probe route, driven, then deleted.

- `/models` renders **14 rows**, all `:free`, sorted largest window first, from Nemotron 3 Ultra at **1M** down to three models at **128K**. Bars are drawn to scale, 100% down to 12.8%, which is the eight-to-one spread the table exists to show.
- The default trio is three genuinely different vendors: **NVIDIA, Google, Poolside**. The arena's chips render those same three, and the picker trigger correctly reads "Change models" rather than "Add model" at the cap.
- **The parser drops exactly the right rows and keeps the rest.** Fed a payload containing a row missing `context_length`, a bare string, a genuinely paid model, and one claiming `:free` while charging for input, it returned only the two real models. Malformed input at the top level returns `null` instead of throwing. The `:free`-but-charging case is the one that matters: the id suffix alone would have let it through.
- **The paid-model hole is closed.** `anthropic/claude-opus-5`, a made-up id and an empty id are all refused; a real free id is allowed.
- **A dead catalog degrades honestly, checked by actually breaking it.** With the URL pointed at an unreachable host, `/models` shows "The catalog didn't answer just now, so there is nothing to list. Nothing else in the arena is affected." with a retry, the arena shows "The model list isn't loading, so there's nothing to send to yet." with a retry and a disabled send button, and the real `TypeError: fetch failed` appears only in the server log. The URL was restored and both pages recovered.
- All five routes still return 200.

### 6. Send a prompt, parallel streams, and voting

The heart of the product. One prompt goes to every selected model at once, each streaming and failing independently, so one being slow or down never blocks the others. Each answer shows its own real time-to-first-token, tokens per second, and total tokens. No cost shown, every model here is free tier, so it would always read zero. A vote only exists once two or more models have answered, and picking one writes exactly one vote and marks that answer as the winner, while every answer stays visible the whole time. A follow-up continues each model's own separate conversation.

Arcjet sits in front of this endpoint before any model is ever called: rate limiting, bot protection, and a shield against prompt injection, plus a real limit on how much one person can use across all three models at once, not just a limit on the endpoint overall.

Every prompt sent, every answer finishing, and every vote cast should be tracked as a real PostHog event, so there's an honest funnel from prompt to answer to vote. A model failing should also be logged properly on the server, not just shown to the user and forgotten. Separately from that funnel, every actual model call should also be wrapped so PostHog captures its own real tokens, cost, and latency per call, that's PostHog's own LLM analytics, not the same thing as the funnel events or the numbers already shown on the response card.

#### Decided: the Arcjet layer, built ahead of the rest of this feature

Arcjet shipped early, on its own, because the endpoint it guards already existed from feature 1 and there was no reason to leave it open while the UI gets built.

**A shared client holds only Shield, route rules layer on with `withRule()`.** `infrastructure/arcjet.ts` exposes a lazy, memoised client carrying `shield({ mode: "LIVE" })` and nothing else. Shield is free and every route wants it. Chat's own rules live in `features/chat/chat-protection.ts`, so one endpoint's rate limit can never silently apply to another. The client is built on first use, not at import, for exactly the reason feature 1 records: `next build` evaluates route modules, and a build must not demand real secrets.

**The rate limit is a token bucket keyed on the Clerk `userId`, not the endpoint or the IP.** Capacity 30, refilling 15 per 60 seconds, one token per call. The browser sends one request per model, so a three-model turn spends three tokens and a one-model turn spends one, which is what makes this a limit on a person's total usage across all three models rather than a per-model allowance that triples the moment someone picks a third model. A fixed or sliding window on the endpoint cannot express that. Measured: exactly 30 calls pass, the 31st returns 429 with a `retry-after` header, and a second user is unaffected.

**`POST /api/chat` now requires sign-in.** No Clerk `userId` means a 401 before Arcjet is called at all, which also means an unauthenticated request never costs a decision. _This contradicts feature 1, which parked route gating in feature 8, and the contradiction is resolved here rather than worked around:_ the rate limit has no honest identity without an authenticated user, and IP keying would have quietly broken the "one person" promise above the moment two people shared a NAT. Feature 8 still owns page visibility and public thread sharing. The cost, accepted deliberately: nobody can try the arena without an account, so there is no signed-out demo.

**The guard runs before the body is parsed.** Nothing in it needs the body, and this ordering means malformed-body spam still spends a token instead of being a free way to hammer the endpoint. _Added by feature 5:_ once the body is parsed, the route also refuses any `modelId` that is not on the live free-tier list, and fails closed if that list cannot be read.

**Bots are denied outright, `allow: []`.** This endpoint is only ever called by our own browser code. No crawler, monitor, or search engine has a reason to reach it, and everything it lets through spends real inference.

_Plan correction, found by building it._ This feature asked for "a shield against prompt injection" and that is **not shipped**. Arcjet bills prompt scanning as a usage-based add-on ($2 per 1M tokens) rather than including it in a plan, and on an account without it the rule does not degrade quietly: the server answers "Unable to detect prompt injection", the entire decision comes back `ERROR`, and every prompt pays a round trip for protection it never receives. Verified directly, then removed, and the dev log went from an error on every call to zero. Re-enabling it is two lines, documented in place in `chat-protection.ts`, once the add-on is actually on the account. Shipping it broken would have looked like protection while providing none, which is worse than not having it.

Denials never leak an Arcjet reason: 429 with a real retry-after for the bucket, 403 otherwise, each a plain sentence. `isErrored()` logs server-side and lets the request through, so an Arcjet outage degrades to an unprotected endpoint rather than a dead one.

- [x] Typecheck, lint and production build all pass

- [ ] Build the rest of the feature: parallel streams, the response cards, and voting

#### Decided: how the rest of this feature is built

**User provisioning is a lazy find-or-create by Clerk `userId`, not a webhook.** Nothing in the schema needs anything more than a `users` row to exist by the time a turn is written, and a webhook is a second endpoint and a secret to manage for a guarantee this already gets for free from the write path below.

**Sending a prompt is two steps, in this order: create the durable record, then stream.** A server action opens one transaction that resolves/creates the `User`, creates (or reuses) the `Thread`, creates the `Turn` (the prompt), and creates one `ModelResponse` row per selected model at `STREAMING`. It returns the thread id and each response's id. Only once that comes back does the browser navigate to `/t/[threadId]` and open the model streams. _Asked, because it forks:_ streaming immediately and relocating the URL underneath the in-flight requests would shave the wait for a first token, but risks a stream dying on a client-side route swap for a saving that isn't worth that fragility yet. From a saved thread, sending a follow-up skips the navigation, everything else is identical.

_Reversed during hardening, and the reversal is the interesting part._ "Create the durable record, then stream" still stands and always did. What was dropped is the navigation in the middle: the first prompt no longer goes to `/t/[threadId]` at all, it renders in place and relocates the URL, which is precisely the option this fork rejected. The rejection's stated reason was that relocating the URL under in-flight requests "risks a stream dying on a client-side route swap" — and that turned out to name the real hazard while pinning it on the wrong mechanism. The route swap _was_ the thing that killed streams, twice. Full argument in [the entry below](#the-first-prompt-stops-navigating-at-all).

**Each selected model gets its own `fetch` to `POST /api/chat`, in parallel, and the client parses the stream itself with `ai`'s `readUIMessageStream` rather than `@ai-sdk/react`'s `useChat`.** Three independent per-model conversations, each with its own measured metrics riding in message metadata, don't fit `useChat`'s single-conversation model any better than what's already hand-rolled in `model-response-metrics.ts`, and pulling in a second AI SDK entry point for one hook isn't worth it.

**A thread's models are locked at turn one.** Once a thread exists, the model picker in its composer goes away (or read-only); a follow-up always addresses the same models the thread started with. _Asked, because it forks:_ letting the set change per turn is more flexible but leaves a thread with responses scattered unevenly across models and turns, and "a follow-up continues each model's own separate conversation" reads most literally as one fixed cast for the thread's life.

~~**Locked at turn one.**~~ _Reversed during hardening, by decision._ Models are changeable on any turn. The lock's own consequence is what argued against it: the picker vanishing from the composer read as a broken control rather than an enforced rule, and it was only ever noticed once the first prompt stopped navigating and the disappearance happened in place. The "responses scattered unevenly" worry above is real and was accepted with eyes open — see [the entry below](#models-are-changeable-on-any-turn).

**Persistence happens server-side, inside the route, not from the client after the stream ends.** `stream-model-response.ts` already builds the exact `ModelResponseMetrics` object at finish; that same object is written into the `ModelResponse` row at that moment (upsert on the existing `@@unique([turnId, modelId])`, which is also what makes an in-place retry of a failed model overwrite its row instead of adding a second one). `FAILED` is written from the same `onError` path that already returns the user-facing sentence. An answer survives a closed tab this way; a client-reported "I finished" would not.

**Follow-up history is rebuilt per model, not shared across models.** Each model's message list is that thread's turns in order: every prompt, plus that model's own prior answer wherever it completed. One model never sees another model's text.

**Voting is a thin server action wrapping the existing `castVote`**, wired straight to the "Pick this" buttons already in the placeholder UI, mapping each `VoteRefusal` to the plain sentence a caller already expects.

**PostHog gets a lazy server client, mirroring `infrastructure/arcjet.ts`'s pattern**, firing `prompt_sent` / `model_answered` / `vote_cast` as the funnel scope.md calls for. `@posthog/ai`'s own per-call capture is done by calling `captureAiGeneration` directly rather than `withTracing`-wrapping the model — _correction, found by building it:_ `withTracing` types its model parameter against the AI SDK's older `LanguageModelV2`/`V3`, and `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider` has already moved to `V4`, so wrapping does not typecheck. Calling `captureAiGeneration` by hand sidesteps the mismatch and reuses the exact same measured numbers already going into `metrics`.

**One more correction, found by building it:** three-model turns turned out to need one more piece than planned — the thread page (`/t/[threadId]`) has to load a thread's real turns from the database, not just its id. The chosen sequencing (create the turn, then navigate, then stream) means the destination page is the first thing that ever sees a turn's `STREAMING` rows, so without a real loader there the prompt just sent would render into an empty screen. This is a minimal turn loader only — the actual sidebar and cross-thread history stays feature 7's job.

- [x] User find-or-create by `clerkId` (`infrastructure/current-user.ts`)
- [x] `start-turn` server action: thread + turn + STREAMING response rows in one transaction (`features/arena/start-turn.ts`)

- [x] Typecheck, lint, and production build all pass

## Slice 2: App shell & thread history

### 7. App shell & thread history

The frame everything else sits inside: a top bar and sidebar that stay in place while the page scrolls, the thread's name, and each model's win record shown right there (shrinking down to a small dot and number if it gets crowded). The sidebar lists a signed-in user's own past threads so the tool actually feels usable across visits, not just in one sitting.

#### Decided

**Built out of order, on purpose, and as UI only.** This is slice 2 arriving before slice 1 because the shell is the frame every other screen needs to sit inside, and building the arena first means building it twice. Everything behind the frame is a labelled placeholder: no live catalog, no streaming, no persisted thread, no real vote. Features 5, 6 and 7 replace those in place.

**Routes, and this was the one genuine fork here because feature 8 makes every thread URL a link somebody pastes elsewhere.** The arena is the product, so it sits at the root with no redirect in front of it, and a saved thread gets a short path:

- `/` the arena, a new thread
- `/t/[threadId]` a saved thread, and the URL feature 8 shares
- `/leaderboard` and `/models`

The breadcrumb still reads "Arena / Thread 1" as sketched. It says where you are; it does not have to mirror the path, and paying a redirect on every visit to the root to make it do so is a bad trade.

**The shell lives in a route group, `app/(shell)/layout.tsx`, not in the root layout.** The root layout owns providers and has to stay wrappable around things that must not get a sidebar, a sign-in screen among them. A route group gives the four real screens the frame and leaves that door open.

**The sidebar is written here rather than pulled from shadcn.** shadcn's sidebar block ships its own eight-colour token set, a cookie persistence layer and a provider, all of which would have to be repainted and reconciled against the palette feature 4 just settled. The sketch is a nav list, a thread list, and a footer. Writing it costs less than adapting it, and it reads the tokens we already have. shadcn still owns the popover, button and skeleton when features 5 and 6 need them.

**The shell's signature element is the standings strip in the top bar.** The sketch already asked for it, and it is the most characteristic thing in this product's world: a running scorecard pinned to the top of the venue. One chip per model in this thread, the model's initial in a ring, its record in tabular mono, updating as votes land. Below a comfortable width the label drops and the chip becomes the ring plus the number, which is exactly the shrink the feature description asked for. Everything else in the shell stays deliberately quiet so this is the thing the eye goes to.

**The thread list groups by recency, and does not number itself.** "Today", "This week", "Earlier". Grouping encodes something true, that a thread from an hour ago and one from last month are different kinds of thing. Numbering would encode a sequence that does not exist. Same reasoning the leaderboard's rank numbers _do_ earn their place: there, order is the content.

**The shell renders for everyone, signed in or not, and gates nothing.** Feature 8 owns page visibility and public sharing, and quietly making a routing decision here would pre-empt it. Signed out, the nav and all three screens still work; the thread list shows a sign-in invitation instead of a list, because a thread list is the one part that genuinely cannot exist without an account. Clerk's user button sits in the sidebar footer beside the theme toggle, per the sketch.

**Responsive and keyboard behaviour, which the accessibility baseline makes a requirement and not a nicety.** The sidebar is persistent from `lg` up and an overlay drawer below it, driven by the same toggle the sketch puts in the top bar. The drawer closes on Escape and on navigation, moves focus into itself when it opens, and returns focus to the toggle when it closes. Every screen gets a skip link to its main content, the active nav item carries `aria-current`, and the top bar and sidebar are landmarks with real labels.

**Placeholder data sits where the real thing will live, one file per feature that replaces it,** so feature 5 deletes one import and feature 6 deletes another, rather than someone hunting fake model names through the tree. Each file says in a comment which feature kills it.

**The style proof page moves to `/design`, unlinked from the nav.** It is still the only way to eye-check the palette, and the root is now the arena. It dies when features 6 and 9 put the real screens in place, same as before.

#### What got built

- `features/shell/`, the frame: `app-shell.tsx` (drawer state, Escape, focus move and return, skip link), `sidebar.tsx`, `top-bar.tsx`, `standings-strip.tsx`, `icons.tsx`, and two placeholder data files.
- `app/(shell)/`, the route group and all five pages: `/`, `/t/[threadId]`, `/leaderboard`, `/models`, and `/design`.
- `features/arena/`, `features/leaderboard/`, `features/models/`, one placeholder screen and one placeholder data file each, every one of them opening with a comment naming the feature that deletes it.
- The style proof moved from `/` to `/design` and lost its own theme toggle, since the shell now carries one.

_Correction, found by building it._ **Clerk 7 has no `SignedIn` or `SignedOut`.** They were replaced by a single `<Show when="signed-in">`, which is a **server** component returning a promise, so a client component cannot use it. The sidebar has to be a client component, it reads `usePathname` for the active item and closes the drawer on navigation, so its signed-in state comes from the `useAuth()` hook instead, and the sidebar footer, which is composed in the server layout, uses `<Show>`. Worth writing down because the obvious import is the one that no longer exists.

**A deliberate departure from the sketch, flagged rather than assumed.** The sketch puts each column's metrics behind a "Metrics" toggle. They are open here instead. Feature 4 made the instrument strip the signature element on the argument that the measured numbers are the reason this product exists, and putting the best thing on the screen behind a disclosure contradicts that. This is the softer kind of sketch conflict, not a structural one, so it was decided rather than escalated — but it is a real change from what was drawn, and putting the toggle back is a small edit if the drawing wins.

**Icons are drawn in `features/shell/icons.tsx` rather than pulled from a package.** The shell needs six glyphs. A dependency that ships a thousand to deliver six is a bad trade, and every icon inherits `currentColor` so an icon is never a second place a colour gets decided.

#### Verified

Against a running dev server, all five routes return 200 with zero errors or warnings in the log. Confirmed in the rendered HTML: the breadcrumb reads "Arena / Thread f3a9c1" on a thread, the standings strip renders there and correctly does **not** render on `/`, since a brand-new thread has no record yet; the skip link, both `nav` landmarks with real labels, and `aria-current="page"` on the active nav item as well as the final breadcrumb; the leaderboard's four rows compute 72 / 54 / 37 / 20 percent from the placeholder counts and carry a table caption; the models grid renders all six cards.

- [x] Decide the approach
- [x] `app/(shell)/layout.tsx` with the sidebar, top bar, and skip link
- [x] Sidebar: nav, thread list grouped by recency, signed-out state, footer with user button and theme toggle
- [x] Top bar: sidebar toggle, breadcrumb, the standings strip
- [x] Drawer behaviour below `lg`, Escape, focus move and return
- [x] The five routes, with labelled placeholder content on each
- [x] Style proof moved to `/design`
- [x] Verified: every route responds, landmarks and `aria-current` present, no server errors
- [x] Typecheck, lint, `format:check` and a real production build all pass
- [ ] **Needs a person:** open a narrow window, confirm the drawer opens, Escape closes it, focus returns to the toggle, and a link inside it closes it. Check both themes.

#### Thread history, wired to the real database

The shell above was UI only; `PLACEHOLDER_THREAD_GROUPS` stood in for a signed-in user's actual threads. This closes that placeholder out.

**The query lives in `features/shell/thread-history.ts`, `server-only`, reading `@/infrastructure/database` directly.** It is feature-specific, not a second `infrastructure/` client: nothing else needs a recency-grouped thread list, so it stays where it is used, the same layering feature 5's picker already draws.

**Recency grouping is computed in the query, not eyeballed from a raw timestamp.** "Today" is the calendar day so far, "This week" the six days before that, "Earlier" everything older, all measured from each thread's `updatedAt`. Empty groups are dropped rather than rendered with a heading and nothing under it.

**A thread's model count is the distinct `modelId`s across all its `ModelResponse` rows, not a stored column.** No `Model` table exists (feature 3's decision) and a thread's model set never changes after turn one (feature 6's decision), so this is cheap to compute and never drifts from what the arena actually locked in.

**`Thread.updatedAt` now advances on a follow-up, not only on creation.** `@updatedAt` only fires on a write to the `Thread` row itself, and `start-turn.ts` previously only ever created or read it, never touched it on a reply. Without a deliberate touch, a thread from six turns ago and one from six months ago sort identically the moment both were merely _created_ around the same time, which is exactly the distinction "grouped by recency" exists to draw. `startTurn` now updates the row on every follow-up inside the same transaction that writes the turn.

**The layout fetches this server-side and hands it down as a prop, rather than the sidebar reading it itself.** The sidebar is a client component (it needs `usePathname` and the drawer's `onNavigate`), and this needs a signed-in `userId` from Clerk plus a database round trip, neither of which belongs in client code. `app/(shell)/layout.tsx` resolves the Clerk `userId`, looks up the app's own `users.id` via `findAppUserId` (no upsert: a shell render should never be the thing that creates a user row), and passes the resulting groups into `AppShell` → `Sidebar` as `threadGroups`. Signed out, or before a first prompt, that's simply `[]`, which the sidebar already had a rule for.

**A new thread needs an explicit `router.refresh()` after `router.push`, and a follow-up needs one too.** The App Router does not re-run a shared layout on a plain navigation between sibling routes it has already rendered, and here the layout is exactly where the thread list is read. Without the refresh, a brand-new thread would not appear in the sidebar until some unrelated hard reload, and a follow-up's recency bump would not reorder it. Both call sites in `arena-screen.tsx` now pair `push`/local state update with `refresh()`.

#### What got built

- `features/shell/thread-history.ts`, the query and its `ThreadSummary`/`ThreadGroup` types. `placeholder-threads.ts` deleted.
- `app/(shell)/layout.tsx` resolves the signed-in user and calls it, passing `threadGroups` down.
- `sidebar.tsx` and `app-shell.tsx` take `threadGroups` as a prop instead of importing the placeholder; a signed-in user with no threads yet sees a plain sentence instead of an empty section.
- `features/arena/start-turn.ts` touches `thread.updatedAt` on a follow-up; `arena-screen.tsx` calls `router.refresh()` after both a new-thread `push` and a follow-up send.

#### Verified

Typecheck, lint and a real production build all pass. Checked against the real running dev server and a real signed-in session (not a throwaway probe, since this reads the account already in use): the sidebar rendered live "Today"/"This week"/"Earlier" groups with real thread titles and model counts, sending a follow-up in an open thread was visible in the server log with no new errors, and the transient `PLACEHOLDER_THREAD_GROUPS` / `threadGroups.length` errors seen mid-edit in the dev log were Fast Refresh serving a stale client module against the old and new prop shape in turn, not a real bug: they stopped the moment the edit finished landing, and the following compiles and requests were clean.

- [x] Decide the approach
- [x] `features/shell/thread-history.ts`: real threads, grouped by recency, with a real model count
- [x] `Thread.updatedAt` bumped on a follow-up so recency reflects real activity
- [x] Sidebar and shell take `threadGroups` as a prop; placeholder file deleted
- [x] `router.refresh()` after a new thread's navigation and after a follow-up
- [x] Typecheck, lint, `format:check` and a real production build all pass
- [x] Verified against a running dev server and a real signed-in session: real groups, titles, and model counts render; no new server errors
- [ ] **Needs a person:** confirm in the browser that a brand-new thread appears in "Today" immediately after the first prompt, and that a follow-up in an older thread moves it back up to "Today" without a manual reload.

## Slice 3: Public visibility & sharing

### 8. Public thread visibility & sharing

Anyone should be able to open a thread's link and see it, without an account, that's what actually makes it shareable. Only sending a prompt and voting need sign-in. A made-up or deleted thread just shows a plain not-found page either way. The thread's real owner sees everything everyone else sees, plus the ability to actually use it.

#### Decided

**The hard part was already built, by features 6 and 7, without either of them meaning to.** `/t/[threadId]` has never had an auth gate, and `startTurn` and `castVote` already refuse anyone but the thread's owner server-side, with a plain sentence, since features 3 and 6 keyed both on `existingThread.userId !== user.id`. Reading the code before deciding anything found that this feature's real job is narrower than it reads: not "make threads visible," they already are, but "make the UI agree with that up front," and add the one thing that's genuinely missing, a way to actually grab the link.

**No `visibility` column, confirmed rather than merely inherited.** Feature 3 parked that decision here on purpose. Now that this feature is being built, the answer is: still no column. Every thread is reachable by its own unguessable id and nothing else, there is no private/public toggle to store, which is exactly what "anyone with the link" already means. Adding a column would model a choice nobody is being asked to make.

**`isOwner` is computed once, server-side, in `ThreadPage`, and carried down as a plain prop.** Resolve the viewer's own Clerk id, look up their app `userId` (no upsert, same reasoning as feature 7: loading a thread should never be the thing that creates a user row), compare it to the thread's `userId` already being read. `ArenaScreen` hides the entire `Composer` behind it and folds `isOwner` into `canVote` alongside the existing two-or-more-answers check. A non-owner sees a single plain sentence instead: "You're viewing someone else's thread. Only its owner can add to it or vote." This is a UI-only change, not a new guard: `startTurn` and `castVote` were already the real enforcement, this just stops a visitor from typing into a box that was always going to refuse them.

**Sharing itself is a "Copy link" button in the top bar, shown on any `/t/[id]` route, for anyone.** Not owner-gated: the url in the address bar is already just as public, so hiding the button from a non-owner would protect nothing while making the feature harder to find for the person who most wants it, someone who was just sent the link. It copies `window.location.href` and confirms with a brief "Copied" swap rather than a bare icon that gives no feedback that anything happened.

**`/t/[threadId]` gets its own Arcjet layer, wired in `proxy.ts` rather than the page.** Making the thread readable with no auth gate turned it into the one route that hits the database with zero Arcjet coverage: Shield only ever attaches where `arcjetClient().withRule(...)` is actually called, and nothing called it here. `page.tsx` is a Server Component and never receives a `Request`, so there's no `protect()` call site inside it at all; `proxy.ts` is the only place upstream of the page that sees one, which is also the first real use of that file beyond running Clerk. `features/threads/thread-protection.ts` mirrors `chat-protection.ts`'s shape: bots denied outright, `allow: []`, same reasoning as chat, this page has no legitimate crawler use case and rich link previews are already out of scope. The rate limit is a sliding window of 60 requests per 60 seconds, keyed on IP rather than `userId`, because there is no signed-in identity to key on here — the whole point of this feature is that there doesn't need to be one. IP is a weaker guarantee than chat's per-user bucket (shared NATs, proxies), which is exactly why the number is generous: it exists to stop volumetric hammering of a link or the route as a whole, not to ever be the reason a real visitor's link fails to load.

#### What got built

- `app/(shell)/t/[threadId]/page.tsx` now selects `userId` on the thread, resolves the viewer's own app user id via Clerk, and passes `isOwner` to `ArenaScreen`.
- `features/arena/arena-screen.tsx`: `isOwner` prop (defaults `true`, since starting a brand-new thread inherently owns it), gates the `Composer` and folds into `canVote`; a non-owner gets the plain-sentence notice instead of the composer.
- `features/shell/top-bar.tsx`: a "Copy link" control on thread routes, with `LinkIcon`/`CheckIcon` added to `features/shell/icons.tsx`.
- `features/threads/thread-protection.ts`: `guardThreadRequest`, Shield (inherited from the shared client) plus bot detection and an IP-keyed sliding window, same denial shape as chat — plain sentence, real reason logged server-side, `isErrored()` lets the request through rather than dying.
- `proxy.ts`: `clerkMiddleware()` now takes a callback that calls `guardThreadRequest` for any `/t/*` path and returns its denial, otherwise falls through. Still gates no route by sign-in; that split stands.

#### Verified

Typecheck, lint, `format:check`, and a real production build all pass. Against a running dev server, using the codebase's established pattern for what `curl` can't reach on its own, a throwaway probe route read a real thread id, then was deleted:

- A made-up thread id still returns a real 404 page.
- A real thread, requested with no session at all (`curl`, so definitely not its owner), returns 200: the page renders, no `<textarea>` and no "Pick this" button appear anywhere in the served HTML, and the plain sentence "You're viewing someone else's thread. Only its owner can add to it or vote." is present. "Copy link" is present on the same page.
- Confirmed directly in the Arcjet console (`requests list` via the CLI) after real traffic: `curl` against `/t/[threadId]` comes back `CONCLUSION_DENY` / `REASON_BOT_V2`, the same real browser loading the same route comes back `CONCLUSION_ALLOW`. Bot detection is live and correctly tells the two apart.

- [x] Decide the approach
- [x] `isOwner` resolved server-side and threaded down to the arena screen
- [x] Composer and every vote button hidden for a non-owner, replaced with a plain sentence
- [x] "Copy link" control on thread routes, for anyone
- [x] Arcjet on `/t/[threadId]`: Shield, bot detection, and an IP-keyed rate limit, wired in `proxy.ts`
- [x] Typecheck, lint, `format:check` and a real production build all pass
- [x] Verified: a made-up thread 404s; a real thread viewed with no session renders read-only, with no composer and no vote button, and the copy-link control present; `curl` against the route is denied as a bot in the Arcjet console while real browser traffic is allowed
- [ ] **Needs a person:** open a thread signed in as its real owner and confirm the composer and vote buttons still render normally; click "Copy link" in a real browser and confirm the clipboard actually holds the url (a headless check can't observe the clipboard itself)

**PostHog follow-up, added after an analytics audit.** The funnel from feature 6 (`prompt_sent` / `model_answered` / `vote_cast`) had no coverage at all for this feature's actual subject, sharing. The first draft of that fix proposed a `thread_visibility_changed` event, which was wrong on inspection: there is no visibility to change, feature 8 confirmed above that no such column or toggle exists, every thread is already public by its unguessable id. Replaced with the event that actually corresponds to a real user action here:

- `thread_link_copied` — fired from the "Copy link" button itself (`features/shell/top-bar.tsx`), the real share action.
- `public_thread_viewed` — fired once from `ArenaScreen` when a non-owner opens a real thread (`features/arena/arena-screen.tsx`), the only signal for whether a shared link is actually viewed by someone besides its owner.

Two more gaps closed at the same time, since they were found during the same audit and are cheap:

- **Reverse proxy** (`next.config.ts`): browser PostHog traffic now rewrites through this app's own `/ingest` path rather than calling the PostHog host directly, so an ad blocker sees first-party traffic. Region-aware: the destination host is read from `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST` itself (currently `eu.i.posthog.com`), not hardcoded to the US region. `posthog-provider.tsx` now sets `api_host: "/ingest"` and keeps `ui_host` as the real host for things the proxy doesn't cover.
- **Exception autocapture** (`capture_exceptions: true` in `posthog-provider.tsx`): model failures already land in `model_answered`, but an unhandled client exception — a render bug, a stray throw — had nowhere to go.

Feature flags, group analytics, and surveys were all considered and skipped: nothing in this app currently has a tier, an org concept, or a research-tooling need for them.

- [x] Reverse proxy for PostHog ingestion (`next.config.ts`)
- [x] Exception autocapture turned on (`posthog-provider.tsx`)
- [x] `thread_link_copied` and `public_thread_viewed` events
- [x] Typecheck, lint, and a real production build all pass
- [ ] **Needs a person:** confirm all four land in the real PostHog project — copy a link, then open it in a private window as a non-owner, and check the project's live events for `thread_link_copied` and `public_thread_viewed`; also confirm `/ingest` requests show as first-party in the Network tab rather than a direct call to `eu.i.posthog.com`

## Slice 4: Leaderboard

### 9. Leaderboard: global & personal

Two leaderboards from the same votes, one for everyone, one just for the signed-in user. Each row's win rate is the big, bold number, in the accent color, with a small bar next to it, always written as "won 4 of 5," never a bare percentage or a made-up score. Smaller, quieter numbers underneath for average speed and time-to-first-token, each clearly labeled. No cost or "cheapest" stat, every model is free, so that number never means anything here. First place gets a subtle highlight, nobody else does.

#### Decided

**The query lives in `features/leaderboard/leaderboard-standings.ts`, `server-only`, reading `@/infrastructure/database` directly.** One function, `getLeaderboardStandings(scopeUserId)`, serves both leaderboards: `null` counts everyone's votes, a signed-in user's app id scopes every number to threads they own. This is the query feature 3 already proved against the real database, grouping by `modelId` with wins joined from votes and average speed over completed answers only.

**"Of" is how many times a model has actually completed an answer, "won" is how many of those were picked, and both come from two separate queries aggregated in memory rather than one SQL group-by.** A model's win only ever exists on a `COMPLETE` response (feature 3's write path already refuses a vote on anything else), and a personal scope filters `ModelResponse` by the thread it belongs to but filters `Vote` directly by `Vote.userId`, since voting is owner-only and a vote's `userId` is always the thread owner. That is simpler than joining through `Turn` and `Thread` a second time and says the same thing.

**Ranking is by win rate descending, ties broken by total answers then name.** The scope's own "not doing" list already parks weighting by sample size as a nice-to-have, so a plain win-rate sort is the honest, undecorated version of what's asked for rather than an invented formula nobody asked for.

**The Global/Personal toggle is a real navigation to `?view=me`, not client state.** Two server-rendered links styled as a segmented control, `aria-current` marking the active one. No JS needed, and the active tab reads correctly on a full page load or a shared URL.

**"Just me" cannot exist without an account, same reasoning as feature 7's thread list.** Signed out, or before resolving a viewer, it fetches nothing and shows a sign-in invitation instead of an empty table.

**No cost column.** Every model here is free tier, so the number would always read the same meaningless zero — the scope says so directly, and feature 9 is where that finally shows up as an omission rather than a decision made elsewhere.

#### What got built

- `features/leaderboard/leaderboard-standings.ts`, the query and the real `LeaderboardRow` type. `placeholder-standings.ts` deleted.
- `features/leaderboard/leaderboard-screen.tsx`, rewritten to take `rows`, `view`, and `needsSignIn` as props instead of the placeholder import. The toggle, the sign-in notice, and an empty-state sentence (distinct wording for "no votes yet at all" versus "no votes on your own threads yet") are new; the table markup is otherwise the same one feature 7 already built and eye-checked.
- `app/(shell)/leaderboard/page.tsx`, now an async Server Component: resolves Clerk, looks up the app user id (no upsert, same reasoning as features 7 and 8), reads `searchParams` for the view, and calls the query.

#### Verified

Typecheck, lint, `format:check` and a real production build all pass. Against a running dev server and the real database: `/leaderboard` renders real rows, ranked by win rate, with a real top row at 80% ("won 4 of 5"), real millisecond and tok/s figures, and no cost column; `/leaderboard?view=me` signed out shows the sign-in invitation instead of a table; the toggle's `aria-current` lands on whichever link matches the current view; the table caption, `role="group"` on the toggle, and the scoped query all read correctly from the served HTML. No server errors in the log.

- [x] Decide the approach
- [x] `leaderboard-standings.ts`: real query, grouped by modelId, wins from votes, averages over completed answers only, scoped by an optional viewer id
- [x] `leaderboard-screen.tsx` wired to real rows; placeholder deleted
- [x] Global/Personal toggle as a real navigation to `?view=me`
- [x] Sign-in invitation when "Just me" has no session; a distinct empty-state sentence when a scope has zero votes
- [x] Typecheck, lint, `format:check` and a real production build all pass
- [x] Verified against a running dev server and the real database: ranked real rows, correct percentages and averages, no cost column, sign-in notice when signed out
- [ ] **Needs a person:** eye-check the win-rate bar and first-place highlight in a real browser, both themes, and confirm the toggle is keyboard-operable

## Hardening

Not a planned feature — work that came back from production and had to be answered.

### Error boundaries, and a shell that degrades instead of dying

_Triggered by a real incident._ On 2 August 2026, right after the feature 9 deploy (`c1653e2`), six unhandled `$exception` events fired from the arena root in a ~98-second window (18:34:30–18:36:08Z), across 2 sessions and 3 ids, then never recurred. The message was React's production-redacted RSC placeholder, so the actual throw isn't recoverable from PostHog — only a digest. The hypothesis is a transient cold-start failure in one of the three server-side awaits in `app/(shell)/layout.tsx` (`auth()`, `findAppUserId`, `listThreadHistory`); confirming which needs the Vercel runtime logs for that window matched against the digest, which is a person's job, not something the code can settle.

What the code _could_ settle was the real defect the incident exposed: there was no `error.tsx` or `global-error.tsx` anywhere under `app/`, so any throw from a Server Component showed Next's default framework error screen — a raw exception with no plain sentence and no retry, which is exactly what the rules forbid. And `(shell)/layout.tsx` wraps every real screen, so the blast radius was the whole app.

#### Decided

**Three layers, because one boundary can't cover its own layout.** An `error.tsx` boundary never catches a throw from the `layout.tsx` of its own segment — only a boundary _above_ it does. Since the suspected culprit is the shell layout itself, catching it needs both a boundary above (the root `global-error.tsx`) and the layout guarding its own reads. So: `(shell)/error.tsx` catches throws from the shell's screens; the layout degrades rather than throws; `global-error.tsx` is the last-resort backstop for anything either misses.

**The layout degrades the same way `fetch-model-catalog.ts` already does.** Its three awaits are wrapped in one `try/catch`: the real reason goes to the server log with `console.error`, and an empty thread list stands in for the history so the frame stays usable. An empty sidebar and a working shell beat a dead page. The catch calls `unstable_rethrow(error)` first, so Next's own control-flow signals — a `redirect()`/`notFound()` from Clerk, and the dynamic-rendering bail-out that marks the route dynamic at build time — pass through untouched and only a genuine failure is swallowed. (Observed both ways: without the rethrow, the build-time dynamic signal got caught and logged; with it, the signal propagates and every shell route is correctly marked `ƒ` dynamic.)

**`global-error.tsx` carries its own styles.** It replaces the entire document — providers, theme context, fonts, `globals.css`, all gone — so it can't lean on any of them. It ships its own `<html>`/`<body>` and an inline `<style>` block with a `prefers-color-scheme` palette, so it reads honestly on a light or dark system with nothing else loaded. Both boundaries reuse the app's existing failure language: the design page's destructive-tinted card, a plain sentence, and a "Try again" / "Reload" action wired to `reset()`.

#### What got built

- `app/(shell)/error.tsx`, the shell-screen boundary. A client component (boundaries must be), logs the error and digest from the client since that's the only place the real reason survives, renders the failure card with a retry.
- `app/global-error.tsx`, the backstop. Self-contained document with its own inline theme-aware styles and a reload action.
- `app/(shell)/layout.tsx`, thread-history reads pulled into a `loadThreadHistory` helper that catches, `unstable_rethrow`s control-flow signals, logs the real reason, and returns `[]` on a genuine failure.

#### Verified

Typecheck, lint, `format:check` and a real production build all pass. Against `next start` with a throwing test route wired temporarily into `(shell)`: the RSC payload shows the `error` boundary installed on the shell segment (it was `$undefined` before), the errorScripts chunk it points at is `error.tsx` itself (contains "This screen didn't load"), the `AppShell` frame still server-renders around the errored content, and no exception text or stack leaks into the HTML — only a numeric digest. React streams an error-boundary fallback to the client rather than SSR-ing its text, so the literal sentence renders on hydration, not in the raw HTML; the boundary and its chunk being wired to the right segment is what curl can confirm. `global-error.tsx`'s text is bundled too. The test route was removed after.

- [x] Decide the approach
- [x] `(shell)/error.tsx`: plain sentence + retry, logs the real reason and digest
- [x] `global-error.tsx`: self-contained, theme-aware backstop with a reload action
- [x] `(shell)/layout.tsx`: degrade on a genuine read failure, `unstable_rethrow` control-flow signals, empty thread list stands in
- [x] Typecheck, lint, `format:check` and a real production build all pass
- [x] Verified boundary wiring, frame survival, and no leaked exception against `next start` with a throwing route
- [ ] **Needs a person:** pull the Vercel runtime logs for 18:34–18:36Z on 2 August 2026 and match the React digest, to name what actually threw
- [ ] **Needs a person:** eye-check both boundary screens in a real browser, in light and dark, and confirm the retry/reload button is keyboard-operable

### A new thread's first answer never appeared until a reload

_Triggered by real use, reported by hand._ On a brand-new thread, the first prompt produced nothing on screen — the models streamed, the answers persisted, but the arena sat at "Thinking…" (or at the empty hero) until the page was reloaded, at which point the full answer was there. Every follow-up in that same thread then streamed live and instantly. The Next dev indicator showed rendering activity throughout the dead window.

Two separate defects, stacked, both in the new-thread hand-off recorded in feature 6 — "create the durable record, then stream", with a navigation in between. That decision is still right and stands; what was wrong was how the navigation was carried out.

#### Decided

**The racing `router.refresh()` is the bug, and it moves into the server action.** `handleSend` fired `router.push('/t/[threadId]')` and `router.refresh()` back to back, unawaited. `push` starts one RSC request for the destination; `refresh` starts a second for whatever the router still considers the current URL, and there is no ordering guarantee between them. Whichever landed second replaced the page segment's cache node — discarding the `ArenaScreen` that had just mounted on `/t/[threadId]`, fired its effect, and opened the three `POST /api/chat` streams. The requests kept running and `markModelResponseComplete` still wrote every row, which is exactly why a reload showed a finished answer: the stream was never the problem, the tree holding its output was thrown away. The symptom was invisible on follow-ups because a follow-up never navigates.

The fix is that nothing in the arena calls `router.refresh()` any more. `startTurn` calls `revalidatePath("/", "layout")` itself, so the invalidation travels back with the action's own response and is already in hand before the browser navigates — one navigation, nothing to race. `"layout"` because the only stale thing is the shell layout's sidebar, which every screen shares. _The cost, accepted deliberately:_ path revalidation also drops the hour-long fetch cache in `fetch-model-catalog.ts` for those paths, so the next render pays one extra OpenRouter round trip. That is once per prompt sent, not once per render, and per-render is the cost that cache was added to avoid.

This also strictly improves the follow-up path, which previously fired `refresh()` _after_ appending the new turn — i.e. re-rendering the whole tree while three streams were open. It happened to be survivable there (same route, same position, so React reconciled rather than remounted) but it was the same hazard waiting on a worse day. Now the fresh tree lands before the turn is appended.

**A `loading.tsx` for the whole `(shell)` group, because the second defect was that nothing rendered at all during the navigation.** There was no `loading.tsx` and no `Suspense` boundary anywhere under `app/`, and every route in the group is dynamic — Clerk's `auth()`, the thread and leaderboard queries, the catalog, plus the Arcjet decision round trip that `proxy.ts` runs in front of `/t/`. So `push` blocked completely on a real server render with the previous screen held frozen, which is what made "nothing happened" the honest reading of the UI. This is the part that produced the visible rendering indicator with no visible change.

It shipped as one file for four screens carrying a single "Loading…" sentence, which fixed the frozen-screen defect and was immediately the wrong answer visually. Superseded within the day by [the skeleton entry below](#loading-states-that-hold-the-screens-shape), which is where the real reasoning about shape now lives. What survives from this step, and is still the load-bearing part, is that the boundary sits beside the shell layout rather than inside a screen, so the sidebar and top bar stay rendered and interactive and only the content area is ever in a loading state.

#### What got built

- `features/arena/start-turn.ts`, `revalidatePath("/", "layout")` on success, with the race and the cache trade-off recorded in place.
- `features/arena/arena-screen.tsx`, both `router.refresh()` calls removed; the new-thread branch is a bare `push`. The module comment now records why a turn in flight must never have its tree swapped.
- `app/(shell)/loading.tsx`, the group-wide boundary — reshaped per route by the next entry.

#### Verified

Typecheck, lint, `format:check` and a real production build all pass. Against the running server, the RSC payload for a shell route now carries a populated `loading` slot pointing at `(shell)/loading.tsx` — it was absent before — and that slot is a sibling of the layout's `children` slot, which is what confirms the frame survives and only the content area swaps. The `Loading…` text and `aria-live="polite"` are both really in the payload rather than only in a client chunk.

### Loading states that hold the screen's shape

_Follow-up to the entry above, asked for directly:_ the single "Loading…" sentence fixed the frozen screen but looked cheap, and a skeleton was asked for instead.

#### Decided

**Feature 4 had already decided this, and re-reading it is what settled the design rather than taste.** Its motion rule permits a skeleton "only where there is a genuine wait with a known shape, the leaderboard table on first load". That clause disqualifies the sentence _and_ disqualifies one shared skeleton: four screens with four different layouts have four different known shapes, and a single fallback would be shaped wrongly for at least three of them. So each route carries its own, mirroring the real geometry of the screen it stands in for — same container width, same column widths, same bordered surface, same composer height — so nothing jumps when the real screen replaces it.

**Static text renders for real; only what needs data gets blocked out.** The page's name and the table's column headers do not depend on any query, so `Leaderboard`, `Models` and the `.text-eyebrow` headers are the real strings. The moment a skeleton appears you already know which screen you are on and what the columns will hold, and only the numbers are missing. Blocking out a heading that is one known word is precisely what makes a loading state read as generic.

The lead paragraphs are the deliberate exception and stay skeletoned rather than duplicated. They are real copy owned by the screen components, and a second hand-maintained copy inside a `loading.tsx` would drift the first time someone edited one and not the other.

**The breathe is an amendment to feature 4's motion rule, and it was asked rather than assumed.** Feature 4 says the instrument strip's settle is the only animation in the app; this adds a second, a slow opacity breathe on skeleton blocks only. The argument for it: a dim block that never moves does not read as content arriving, it reads as content that failed, which is the opposite of what a loading state owes someone waiting. It is opacity-only and 1.6s so it cannot compete with the strip's 150ms settle — the strip is still where all the motion boldness is spent — and the existing `prefers-reduced-motion` reset already stops it dead. Feature 4's own text has been amended in place rather than left to contradict the code.

**One `.skeleton` class in `globals.css`, owning colour and breathe but not shape.** It appears across five files, which is the "same handful of classes in three places is a component" rule by a wide margin. It sets `bg-muted` and the animation; width, height and radius stay per-instance, because those belong to whatever the block is standing in for. Pointedly not `.measure-bar`, which already means "a number drawn to scale" — a thing you can read, where a skeleton is the absence of a thing.

**The skeleton markup lives in the feature, not in `app/`.** `arena-skeleton.tsx` sits beside `arena-screen.tsx` so the two change in the same commit when the layout moves, which is the folder-by-feature rule doing real work. The `loading.tsx` files are one-line re-exports. The arena's composer shell is shared between the root and the thread route from that one module rather than copied into two route files.

**The whole visual scaffold is `aria-hidden` behind one `sr-only` sentence.** A skeleton is decoration that announces a wait; read aloud, a table of empty cells is worse than no table. The sentence is the honest version of the same information, which is also why the scaffold uses grids rather than `<table>` — no fake table semantics to hide.

_Note on process:_ `frontend-design` never fired because it is installed against a different project (`DevTrack`), not this one. Per `CLAUDE.md` it was read and followed directly from disk instead of assumed active. Its "spend your boldness in one place" is the reason the breathe is the only liberty taken here and the palette, radius and border treatment are entirely feature 4's.

#### What got built

- `app/globals.css`, the `.skeleton` component class and its `skeleton-breathe` keyframes.
- `features/arena/arena-skeleton.tsx`, `ArenaSkeleton` and `ThreadSkeleton` over a shared composer shell.
- `features/leaderboard/leaderboard-skeleton.tsx` and `features/models/models-skeleton.tsx`, each mirroring its own table's real column widths.
- Four `loading.tsx` files: `(shell)/`, `(shell)/t/[threadId]/`, `(shell)/leaderboard/`, `(shell)/models/`.

#### Verified

Typecheck, lint, `format:check` and a real production build all pass.

**The served CSS was inspected rather than the source, which is the only check that can catch this class of mistake:** Tailwind emits _nothing at all_ for a utility it does not recognise, so an arbitrary-value class that never compiled would have failed silently and looked like a layout bug. In the production bundle, `.skeleton` resolves to `background-color:var(--muted)` with `animation:1.6s ease-in-out infinite skeleton-breathe`, the keyframes are emitted, both arbitrary grid templates resolved to the exact intended column widths (`3rem 1fr 14rem 9rem 8rem` and `1fr 6rem 12rem`), and `min-w-3xl` resolved to `--container-3xl: 48rem`, matching the real leaderboard table rather than silently collapsing. `--muted` resolves in both modes with hex fallbacks, `#efeae4` light and `#2b221c` dark.

**The reduced-motion escape hatch was confirmed to actually win, not just to exist.** The `prefers-reduced-motion` block sets `animation-duration:.01ms!important` and `animation-iteration-count:1!important` on `*`, and it is emitted _after_ `.skeleton` in the bundle, so both cascade position and `!important` are on its side.

- [x] Decide the approach, and re-read feature 4 before designing rather than after
- [x] Ask the one real fork (static blocks versus a breathe) instead of assuming it
- [x] `.skeleton` in `globals.css`, colour and motion only, shape per instance
- [x] Per-route skeletons mirroring each screen's real geometry
- [x] Feature 4's motion rule amended in place, not quietly contradicted
- [x] Typecheck, lint, `format:check` and a real production build all pass
- [x] Verified in the served CSS: every arbitrary utility compiled, tokens resolve in both modes, reduced-motion genuinely wins
- [ ] **Needs a person:** navigate to each of the four screens and confirm nothing jumps when the real content replaces the skeleton — the column widths are copied by hand from the real tables and only the eye can confirm they still match.
- [ ] **Needs a person:** eye-check the block contrast in both themes. `bg-muted` on `bg-card` is one lightness step by design, which is quiet on purpose; confirm it reads as content-arriving and not as an empty box.
- [ ] **Needs a person:** confirm the breathe stops with OS "reduce motion" on, and that it does not fight the instrument strip's settle when a real answer lands.

### The first prompt stops navigating at all

_Triggered by real use, again._ After the redirect was fixed and the skeleton landed, the remaining complaint was latency: a first prompt took 3–4 seconds locally and 7–10 in production before the new thread appeared. The proposal that settled it came from outside the code — "redirect instantly, show the skeleton, fetch after" — which is not literally possible, and pointed straight at the better answer anyway.

**Why the literal version cannot work:** the redirect target is `/t/{threadId}`, and the `threadId` is produced by the very write the redirect is trying to get ahead of. Generating an id client-side and navigating early only moves the failure: the thread page cannot distinguish "not written yet" from "does not exist" and would `notFound()` on the user's own new thread.

#### Measured first

Before deciding, the send path was counted rather than guessed. `pooled.db.prisma.io` answers in **~52ms per round trip** from a dev machine. A first prompt made **~9–10 sequential** round trips: the `user.upsert`, then `BEGIN`, `thread.create`, `turn.create`, three `modelResponse.create`s and `COMMIT` inside one interactive transaction. The three creates are wrapped in `Promise.all` and do **not** parallelise — they share one transaction connection and serialise — which is worth knowing before anyone "optimises" that line. On top of that the catalog is **530KB across 337 models, ~350ms** cold. So roughly 1–2s is accounted for; the rest is cold start and production region distance, which only Vercel's own function logs can settle.

#### Decided

**A regression of ours was on that path, and it went first.** `revalidatePath("/", "layout")` in `startTurn` — added one step earlier in this same hardening pass to fix the sidebar — turned out to be far more expensive than its own note claimed. That note said "the next render pays one more OpenRouter round trip". Wrong placement: a server action that revalidates re-renders the current route and ships that tree back _in the action's own response_, so every prompt waited on a full extra page render plus a cold 530KB catalog refetch that the revalidation had itself just purged, before the caller was even told the turn existed. Then the destination page fetched the catalog cold a second time, for the same reason. Removed outright.

**The first prompt renders in place and relocates the URL with `history.replaceState`.** This is the reversal of feature 6's fork, and the evidence changed in a specific way worth writing down: that fork rejected relocating the URL because it "risks a stream dying on a client-side route swap". The instinct was right and the attribution was backwards. A route swap is exactly what killed the streams — first as the `push`/`refresh` race, then as pure latency, because a redirect cannot begin until the row exists and so every first prompt paid a second full page render before a single token could arrive. `replaceState` performs no route swap at all, which is what makes it the safe option rather than the fragile one. What the fork was protecting against is the thing it chose.

The gains are structural rather than tuned: no destination render, no second cold catalog fetch, no Arcjet proxy hop on the send path, and the streams open roughly a second sooner because they no longer wait on a page render. `/t/[threadId]` is untouched and still serves shared links, reloads and sidebar navigation.

**The turn goes on screen before the round trip, not after.** Removing the navigation alone would still have left the composer looking inert for the length of the write plus any cold start, so a turn is appended immediately with placeholder ids and `optimistic: true`, showing the prompt in its bubble and every column reading "Thinking…", which is honestly what is happening. The streaming effect skips optimistic turns by that flag, because a stream opened against a placeholder `turnId` would be refused by `/api/chat` and would turn a healthy turn into a failed one. When the real ids arrive the turn is replaced wholesale rather than patched, so the ids and the cleared flag land in one commit. A refusal removes it again rather than leaving a prompt on screen the database never accepted.

**`threadId` and `lockedModels` become client state seeded from props.** A brand-new thread starts as `null`/`null` and acquires both mid-session with no navigation to carry them, so from the first send onward the client is the authority on which thread is open. This is also what locks the composer's model picker at turn one without a server round trip.

**The sidebar is now one navigation behind, deliberately.** With no navigation and no revalidation, a thread created this way does not appear in the sidebar's server-rendered list until the next real navigation or reload. Both ways of forcing that reread — `router.refresh()` or a `revalidatePath` — re-render the current route and reapply its tree, which is the exact move that cost us the streams twice already, and after `replaceState` it carries a worse risk: the router may still consider the current route `/`, so reapplying its tree would wipe the on-screen conversation. A sidebar one navigation behind is a much smaller price, and it corrects itself the moment you go anywhere. _This also silently reverts the follow-up `router.refresh()` that fed the sidebar's recency grouping;_ same trade, now consistent across both paths.

#### What got built

- `features/arena/turn-state.ts`, the `optimistic` flag and why nothing may stream against such a turn.
- `features/arena/arena-screen.tsx`, one send path for both cases; `liveThreadId`/`liveLockedModels` state; `replaceState` passing Next's own history state straight back through so the back button survives; no `router.push` or `router.refresh` anywhere in the file.
- `features/arena/start-turn.ts`, `revalidatePath` removed, with the reason recorded in place so nobody re-adds it.

#### Verified

Typecheck, lint, `format:check` and a real production build all pass. `/`, `/leaderboard` and `/models` all answer 200 against a running server. Confirmed by grep that no `router.push`, `router.refresh` or `revalidatePath` call survives anywhere in `features/arena/` outside comments and the one noted below.

- [x] Measure the send path before designing anything
- [x] Remove the `revalidatePath` regression from the action
- [x] First prompt renders in place; `replaceState` relocates the URL
- [x] Optimistic turn with placeholder ids, skipped by the streaming effect, replaced wholesale
- [x] `threadId` and `lockedModels` become client state
- [x] Feature 6's fork amended in place with the changed evidence
- [x] Typecheck, lint, `format:check` and a real production build all pass
- [ ] **Needs a person, and this is the whole point:** send a first prompt on a brand-new thread. The prompt and three "Thinking…" columns should appear instantly, the URL should become `/t/{id}` with no page transition, and tokens should arrive noticeably sooner than before. Time it against the old 7–10s.
- [ ] **Needs a person:** confirm `replaceState` interop — reload the page mid-stream and after, and check the back button goes where you came from rather than to a blank `/`. This is the main technical risk in the change.
- [ ] **Needs a person:** confirm exactly one trio of `POST /api/chat` per turn in DevTools, and no request carrying an `optimistic-…` turn id.
- [ ] **Needs a person:** confirm the sidebar picks up the new thread on the next navigation, and decide whether one-navigation-behind is acceptable or worth solving properly (a client-side sidebar update is the safe way, and it is cross-feature plumbing a route would have to compose).
- [ ] **Known sharp edge:** `composer.tsx`'s catalog-failure "Try again" button still calls `router.refresh()`. It is user-initiated and only renders when the catalog is unavailable, so nothing is normally in flight, but after `replaceState` it is the one remaining path that could reapply the wrong tree. Left alone rather than changed unasked.
- [ ] **Unrelated, found while measuring:** `listThreadHistory` selects every thread → every turn → every response to compute a distinct model count, and Prisma runs nested selects as separate queries. It grows with every prompt ever sent. Not on the send path any more, but it is on every shell render.
- [ ] **Unrelated, found while measuring:** `ARCJET_MODE` is set in `.env.local` but is absent from the env schema and read nowhere; the rules are hardcoded `mode: "LIVE"`.

### Models are changeable on any turn

_Reported as a bug, and it was a real one underneath._ "In the prompt input box, the add model button is gone." It was gone on purpose — models were locked at turn one, so the picker was replaced by plain chips once a thread existed. What made it read as breakage rather than a rule is the previous entry: the first prompt no longer navigates, so the picker now vanishes _in place_, under the cursor, with no page change to explain it. A rule you only discover by watching a control disappear is not a rule anybody was told.

Given the choice between signposting the lock and removing it, the lock went.

#### Decided

**The database always allowed this, which is what made it cheap.** `ModelResponse` rows hang off a `turnId` with their own `modelId`, unique on `[turnId, modelId]`. A thread whose first turn ran three models and whose fourth runs a different three was always representable — no migration, no schema change. The lock was application policy in two places (`startTurn` reading models back out of prior turns, and the composer hiding its picker) and nothing more.

**`startTurn` stops deriving models from prior turns and trusts the caller's ids.** This deletes a `modelResponse.findMany` from every follow-up, so the change makes sending marginally faster rather than slower.

**The `MIN`/`MAX` check now runs on every turn.** It used to be gated on `threadId === null`, which was correct while a follow-up's models came from the database and wrong the moment they come from the caller — an unchecked follow-up could ask for none or for fifty.

**Submitted ids are resolved against the live free catalog, not merely validated.** The stored `modelName` is the catalog's own; `StartTurnModel.name` is now read nowhere on the server. The browser still sends it because it needs the name locally to render the turn, and the server discards it. Fails closed like `/api/chat`: a catalog we cannot read is not permission to record a turn against models we cannot vouch for.

_This reverses advice given one message earlier in the same conversation, and the reversal is the honest part._ Validating here was first dismissed as putting latency back on the send path. That was reasoning from a world that had just been deleted: while `revalidatePath` was purging the catalog's fetch cache on every send, every read was cold and cost a 530KB round trip. With that gone the catalog is cached for an hour and read on every page render, so it is warm virtually always and this check costs approximately nothing.

**Ids are deduplicated before they are counted.** Not tidiness: `@@unique([turnId, modelId])` means the same id twice fails the insert and surfaces as a raw database error, which this app never shows anyone. The UI cannot produce a duplicate; a hand-written request can.

**A model that has left the free list is explained, not silently dropped.** The composer matches its selection against the live catalog, so an id that is gone simply produces no chip. Left alone that is a thread whose composer shows fewer models than it ran and a send button that refuses with no reason given — indistinguishable from a broken app. So the footer line says what happened and what to do, and there are two versions because the situations differ: some models lost, and every model lost.

Counting those dead ids was also a trap worth recording. Floor and cap were computed from `selectedIds`, which still contained them, so a thread that opened with three models and lost two would sit at "3 of 3 selected" showing one chip, and refuse to let you add the replacement you needed. Every count now comes from what the catalog actually offers, and a toggle prunes the rest away.

**The composer opens on the thread's _most recent_ turn's models**, so a follow-up repeats the same cast unless you change it. The first turn's set would be the wrong default the moment someone has already swapped something.

**Accepted with eyes open:** feature 6's "responses scattered unevenly across models and turns" is now possible, and a model added at turn three genuinely has no answers for turns one and two. `buildModelMessages` already handled exactly this shape — it feeds a model the prompts plus only its _own_ completed answers — because it had to cope with a model that failed a turn. So a newly added model sees the conversation's questions but claims no answers it never gave, which is the honest reading.

**No Arcjet or PostHog coverage changed.** Asked directly and checked rather than assumed: `shield`, the `/api/chat` bot rule and token bucket, and the `/t/` sliding window are all untouched, and the bucket still spends one token per model call regardless of which models. Every funnel event still fires, and `prompt_sent` gets _better_ data — it already carried `modelIds` and `modelCount`, which now records a real per-turn cast instead of a value that was constant for a thread's life.

#### What got built

- `features/arena/start-turn.ts`, caller-chosen models on every turn, dedupe, always-on count check, catalog resolution, and the `findMany` deleted.
- `features/arena/composer.tsx`, the `locked` prop and its branch gone, picker always present, counts taken from available models only, and the unavailable-model explanation.
- `features/arena/arena-screen.tsx`, `lockedModels` prop and `liveLockedModels` state both removed — the composer owns selection now, so there is nothing to hand back and forth.
- `app/(shell)/t/[threadId]/page.tsx`, opens the composer on the latest turn's models.

#### Verified

Typecheck, lint, `format:check` and a real production build all pass. Confirmed by grep that the only surviving `locked` identifier is `model-picker.tsx`'s local floor/cap flag, which is a different idea, and that the Arcjet and PostHog call sites are all still in place.

- [x] Decide the approach, and surface the contradiction with feature 6 rather than working around it
- [x] Unlock models per turn; delete the derived-from-prior-turns lookup
- [x] `MIN`/`MAX` on every turn; dedupe ids; resolve names from the catalog
- [x] Explain an unavailable model instead of dropping it silently
- [x] Fix the floor/cap trap that counted models the catalog no longer has
- [x] Feature 6's lock amended in place, with the accepted cost written down
- [x] Confirm no Arcjet or PostHog coverage was lost
- [x] Typecheck, lint, `format:check` and a real production build all pass
- [ ] **Needs a person:** on an existing thread, swap a model and send. The new model should answer, and the old turns should still render with their own model sets.
- [ ] **Needs a person:** confirm the new model's answer reads sensibly given it has no prior answers of its own — this is the accepted cost above, and it is worth seeing once on a real thread before trusting it.
- [ ] **Needs a person, hard to stage:** the unavailable-model path only triggers when a model actually leaves OpenRouter's free list, so it cannot be exercised on demand. The message wording is unverified against a real occurrence.
- [ ] **Still open from the previous entry:** `replaceState` interop — the breadcrumb, standings strip and `thread_link_copied` property read `usePathname()`, which Next documents as syncing with `replaceState` but which remains unconfirmed here.

### The sidebar catches up without a server round trip

_The accepted cost from two entries up, un-accepted._ Removing the navigation left the sidebar's thread list one navigation behind: a brand-new thread was open on screen and absent from the list beside it until a reload. That was recorded as a deliberate trade and it was the wrong call — sending one prompt and then clicking "New thread" means never seeing your first thread at all.

#### Decided

**The browser reports what it did; the server list stays the truth.** Both ways of forcing a reread — `router.refresh()` or a `revalidatePath` — re-render the current route and reapply its tree, and that is the single mechanism that has broken the arena twice in this hardening pass. So nothing is refreshed. A small client store holds "threads this browser has sent to", and the sidebar folds that into whatever the last server render gave it.

_A correction to the analysis that chose this._ The case against `router.refresh()` was first put as "it would wipe the on-screen conversation", which overstates it: `refresh()` preserves client component state rather than remounting, which is exactly why the old follow-up refresh never killed a stream. The real objection is narrower and still decisive. After `replaceState` it is unverified whether the router considers the URL `/t/{id}` or still `/`; if the latter, it refetches `/`, and whether React then preserves `ArenaScreen` or remounts it depends on page-segment keys. Remounting resets `turns` and the conversation vanishes from screen while sitting safely in the database — which is precisely the first bug reported in this pass. Most likely `refresh()` is fine. "Most likely" is not the standard for the one area with a two-for-two failure record, and it cannot be settled here because this project has no browser automation by decision.

**Two jobs, because the second was nearly missed.** The obvious job is adding a thread the list does not have. The sibling symptom, found while weighing the options rather than after shipping, is recency: a follow-up bumps `updatedAt`, so a month-old thread should jump from "Earlier" to "Today", and a fix that only handled new threads would have left that broken. `router.refresh()` would have got it for free. So the arena reports **every** send, not only the one that creates a thread, and the merge both adds and promotes.

**Server data wins wherever it exists, which is what makes this self-cleaning.** The store's `modelCount` counts only the turn just sent, where the server counts every model across the whole thread. So the merge prefers the server's row whenever it has one, and uses the caller's values only for a thread the server has never mentioned — exactly the case where they are complete and correct. The consequence worth stating: the moment any navigation brings the real list back, the fold-in becomes a no-op instead of a second copy. Nothing has to remember to clear it.

**The store lives in `infrastructure/`, and that is the rule rather than a preference.** `features/arena` writes to it and `features/shell` reads it, and a feature may not import another feature. `docs/coding-standards.md` names this case exactly: "if two features need the same thing, it belongs in `infrastructure/`". No route plumbing, no callback threaded through props.

**`thread-history.ts` split in two, the same way `model-catalog.ts` is.** It was `server-only` because it queries Postgres, but the sidebar is a client component and needs the same recency labels the query sorts into. Duplicating `"Today"` into client code would be a string that could drift from the grouping that produced it, so the shapes, the labels and the merge moved to `thread-groups.ts` with no `server-only` mark, and the query kept the rest. This also fixed something latent: `app-shell.tsx` had been importing `ThreadGroup` as a type _from the `server-only` module_, which worked only because types are erased.

**`startTurn` returns the title it stored.** The rule is "first 80 characters of the first prompt", and the browser now needs the title to draw the row. Returning it keeps that rule in one place instead of reimplementing `prompt.slice(0, 80)` client-side where it could quietly diverge.

**A missing provider degrades to a no-op rather than throwing.** The context defaults to an empty store with a do-nothing writer. Crashing the arena because a sidebar convenience was not wired is not a trade worth making.

#### What got built

- `infrastructure/thread-history-store.tsx`, the client store: most-recent-first, one entry per thread, no-op default.
- `features/shell/thread-groups.ts`, the pure half — shapes, labels, `groupLabel`, and `mergeTouchedThreads`.
- `features/shell/thread-history.ts`, now just the query.
- `features/shell/sidebar.tsx`, renders the merged list; `features/shell/app-shell.tsx`, type import repointed at the pure module.
- `app/(shell)/layout.tsx`, wraps the whole shell so the writer inside `children` and the reader in the sidebar share one store.
- `features/arena/arena-screen.tsx` reports every send; `features/arena/start-turn.ts` returns `threadTitle`.

#### Verified

Typecheck, lint, `format:check` and a real production build all pass.

**The merge is pure, so it was actually exercised rather than reasoned about** — seven cases, all passing: an untouched list is returned identically and no empty "Today" is invented; a brand-new thread appears under Today; a thread the server already lists produces no duplicate and keeps the server's title and count over the client's; a touched thread moves out of "Earlier" into "Today"; its old group survives if other threads remain and is dropped if not; touched threads order most-recent-first ahead of the server's own Today rows; and Today always leads while later groups keep server order. Run as a one-off script against the real module in the session scratchpad — no test runner was added, per `CLAUDE.md`.

- [x] Catch the recency-regrouping sibling symptom before shipping rather than after
- [x] Client store in `infrastructure/`, per the two-features rule
- [x] Split `thread-history.ts` into pure and `server-only` halves
- [x] `startTurn` returns the stored title so the 80-character rule has one home
- [x] Verified the merge against seven real cases, including self-cleaning
- [x] Typecheck, lint, `format:check` and a real production build all pass
- [ ] **Needs a person:** send a first prompt on a new thread and confirm the row appears in the sidebar immediately, with the prompt as its title and no reload.
- [ ] **Needs a person:** send a follow-up to an older thread and confirm it moves up to "Today".
- [ ] **Needs a person:** then navigate to `/leaderboard` and back, and confirm the row is still there exactly once — this is the self-cleaning path, and a duplicate here is the one failure mode the unit checks cannot see.
- [ ] **Still open, and it will be visible here:** the new sidebar row's active highlight uses `usePathname()`, which is the unverified `replaceState` sync question from two entries up. The row may appear correctly but not be highlighted until a real navigation.

## Not doing right now

Kept here so the plan stays honest about what's deliberately left out.

- A "fastest" label on the leaderboard, tagging whichever model already has the best average speed, only for models with enough votes to mean anything. Nice to have, not required.
- Giving each model's own little icon a distinct look instead of plain gray. Nice to have, not required.
- Privacy policy and terms pages.
- Rich link previews when a thread gets shared somewhere.
- Any kind of admin or moderation page.
- A public API for the leaderboard data. Nobody's asked for this.
