## <a name="introduction">✨ Introduction</a>

LLM Arena is a unique measuring instrument built to evaluate open-source AI models based on real data, not just vibes. Users submit a single prompt, and the arena races up to three different models side-by-side in real-time, streaming their answers and tracking exact metrics like tokens per second, time to first token, and cost. Users then vote on the winning response, dynamically updating a public leaderboard to reveal which models actually perform best for real-world tasks.
